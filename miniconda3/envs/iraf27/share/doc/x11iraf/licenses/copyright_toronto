 * *** NOTE: this code has been altered slightly for use in Tcl: ***
 * *** 1. Use ckalloc and ckfree instead of  malloc and free.	 ***
 * *** 2. Add extra argument to regexp to specify the real	 ***
 * ***    start of the string separately from the start of the	 ***
 * ***    current search. This is needed to search for multiple	 ***
 * ***    matches within a string.				 ***
 * *** 3. Names have been changed, e.g. from regcomp to		 ***
 * ***    TclRegComp, to avoid clashes with other 		 ***
 * ***    regexp implementations used by applications. 		 ***
