Building this IRAF from source
--

./build 32

./build.x11iraf 32


--

build and build.x11iraf both source build.setup to get the correct environment

BUILD_NOTES.early contains notes about how we got this to work.  It gives
some insight into the procedure that ./build uses.

Outstanding problems or quirks:

- When building VOPS, a number of object files from the ak/ subdirectory get
  appended to libvops.a twice, producing a warning from libtool. Apparently
  the build just appends more copies each time it is run, but this is thought
  to be harmless.
