# ludcmp -- lower-upper decomposition
# This routine decomposes a matrix (in-place) into lower and upper
# triangular portions.  This is the same as the Numerical Recipes version
# except that memory is allocated instead of using the fixed array VV.
# Phil Hodge, 28-Oct-1988  Subroutine copied from Numerical Recipes.
