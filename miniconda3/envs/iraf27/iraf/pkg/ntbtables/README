This directory contains the source for the SDAS table I/O routines.  All
procedure names begin with "tb".  The next letter usually gives some idea of
the kind of object the procedure deals with (t - table, r - row, c - column,
p - parameter, h - header parameter).  Procedures beginning with "tbx", "tby",
"tbf" or "tbz" are lower-level routines for row-ordered tables, column-ordered
tables, FITS tables or text tables respectively.

The top-level procedures are listed in calls.doc in the doc subdirectory.

A description of the file format of a table is given by fileformat.doc in
the doc subdirectory.

In Ureka, the new core IRAF version of libtbtables.a has been renamed to
libntbtables.a, to distinguish it from the libtbtables that is still bundled
as part of STScI's TABLES package. Currently our code is not compatible with
the modified library in the IRAF core and most external IRAF packages have
likewise been tested against the original version. If you are compiling your
own SPP code in Ureka with the TABLES libraries and want the behaviour to be
identical to what you'd get with NOAO's IRAF 2.16 distribution, you can create
the following symbolic link to get NOAO's libtbtables at compile time (not
tested):

  cd $UR_DIR/iraf/lib
  ln -s libntbtables.a libtbtables.a
