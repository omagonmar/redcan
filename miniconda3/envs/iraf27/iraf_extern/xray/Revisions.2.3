1.  /pros/xray/xspatial/imcnts/imcnts.x				DS 7/16/93
    /pros/xray/xspatial/imcnts/imcntsubs.x
Corrected error of taking background or background error file names that 
begin with numbers, as constant values.

2.  /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/fld_phots.x			JD 7/19/93
Corrected t_exp routine in response to a hotseat question from Dennis Leahy.
The exposure being assigned to bins with a period on the same order as the
size of the gti's was fixed to recognize the correct number of bins needing
exposure time.

3. /pros/xray/xplot/imcontour/imc_clevels.x        		JD 7/20/93
Computed contour levels often missed the lowest level specified by the user.  
The routines imc_log & imc_linear were corrected to account for precision 
errors in lower_limit calculations.

4. /pros/xray/xtiming/  chiplot.cl, fftplot.cl fldplot.cl,      JD 7/20/93
                        ftpplot.cl, ltcplot.cl

   /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/eincdrom/doc/qp_get.hlp

Modified qp_get.cl to run qpaddaux after running fits2qp on IPC and HRI
events.  This will create TSI records from the TGR records in the qpoe
file.

8. /pros/xray/xplot/doc/pspc_hrcolor.hlp			DS 8/2/93
Gave correct attribution to Carlo Izzo.  (We had said Tomaso Belloni.)

    /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/eincdrom/doc/qp_get.hlp
Modified the default setting of qp_mkindex from "no" to "yes", since Einstein
CDROMs so far only contain fits files which are position sorted.

12. /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/sdfspec.par			        DVS 8/25/93
Modified parameter file so that automatic parameters come before hidden 
parameters.  (Enhancement # 390.)

    /pros/xray/xspatial/doc/makevig.hlp
Modified BUGS in xpr2qp help file to report bug that xpr2qp does not create
deffilt information.  Included workaround in xpr2qp help file.  Also
updated makevig help file to report that Einstein vignetting values
beyond 30' are to be "used with extreme caution".  
(Enhancements # 652  & 596.)	

14. /pros/xray/lib/regions/rgop.x				DS 8/30/93
    /pros/xray/lib/regions/mkpkg
Added a call to pl_compress() from rg_flush(), to keep obsolete scanlines 
from clogging up memory when making large complex masks.  (Bug 253)
Also added (in mkpkg) rgop.o's dependence on <plio.h> and rgop.com.  The 
dependencies aren't new, they were just missing.

15. /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/eincdrom/_fits_find/fitsnm2hour.x  DVS 8/30/93
Modified error message received when user types in "i####" instead of

to avoid naming collision with period's EXT_CHI file.
Also created new extensions EXT_OAH, EXT_BOA, EXT_BAL in preparation for
xspectral's use of RDF.

18. /pros/xray/lib/ext.h					DS 9/2/93
    /pros/xray/lib/pros/fnames.x

Macro to convert Rev0 FITS ephemeris files in MPE or US data formats to RDF 
format.  Only columns effecting calc_bary are updated. MJDINT & MJDFRAC are 
added to the table (by utmjd task), and the Satellite vector column names are 
changed to new RDF names (using table tasks).  Original calc_bary is then
called (_clc_bary) on the reformated data (or input rdf if input was not rev0).

23.  /pros/xray/xproto/rdfrall.cl				JD 9/20/93
     /pros/xray/xproto/mkhkscr/*.x 
     /pros/xray/xproto/data/htsiqlm.tab
Macro and code to make an ALL QPOE from the RDF _bas.fits file.  The hk
filter is made generically (using htsiqlm.tab) so that it can work for
other instruments.  MKHKSCR make a hk filter from a qlim extension.

87.  /pros/xray/xspatial/imcnts/imcnts.x			DS 10/25/93
Made imcnts put a standard header on the output table file.
[Forgot to check this in at the time of the change.]

88.  /pros/xray/xspectral/source/pspc_fold.x			DS 12/2/93
Corrected logic error that made pspc_energy() accept any value for nbounds
instead of just PSPC_CHANNELS + 1 or PSPC_PITCH + 1.

89.  /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/vign_correct.x			DS 12/2/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/data/ros_pi_offar	[new file]
     /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec.par
Corrected vignetting correction computation, doing it in PI space instead
of in energy space.

91.  /pros/xray/xspectral/data/ros_pi_offar.ieee  [new name]	DS 12/3/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec.par
Renamed ros_pi_offar.ieee, from ros_pi_offar, for consistency with names 
of other spectral data files.

92.  /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		DS 12/3/93
Added header parameter SUBINST, changed LIVETIME from double back to real,
changed FILTER from text back to int.

93.  /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		DS 12/3/93
Undid part of previous change:  SUBINST was already being put out, and the
change I made made it incorrect sometimes.

94.  /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x			DS 12/3/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dsdisp.x
Added units to column headings, and corrected title of cts_tot column.
Changed screen display to match new column headings in _obs.tab file.

95.  /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		DS 12/3/93
Restored what I undid in 93, but in a form that preserves a value if the 
RDF file provides one, else takes one from the QP_SUBINST header field.

96.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/xmask.x				DS 12/3/93
Backed out change 59; it created some problems, so we'll have to redo it.

97.  /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		DS 12/6/93
Display output (pre-RDF) table file name.

98.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/xmask.x				DS 12/7/93
     /pros/xray/lib/pros/tbhead.x
     /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/tim_addmsk.x
Restored change 59, correcting the problems of reading the resulting string. 
(Also, now '\\' replaces '\n', to allow for directory paths.)

99.  /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x			DS 12/7/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dsdisp.x
"net" and "neterr" restored as column headings and in screen display 
(instead of "counts" and "stat_err").

100. /pros/xray/lib/regions/regparse.yy				DS 12/7/93
Fixed the bug that DVS diagnosed, of leaving a couple of files open.

101.	/pros/xray/xplot/pspc_hrcolor.x				MC 12/03/93
Add user specified PI bands for 3 colors

102.	/pros/xray/xdataio/qpappend.x				MC 12/15/93
Fix qpappend to discard TSI records if record formats do
not match for all input files

103.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/fits2qp.h			MC 12/8/93
				ft_nxtext.x
				ft_ratfits.x
Add addition TLMIN/MAX keywords to data structure and use
TLMAX to set QPOE dimensions if AXLEN keywords not present

104.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qp2fits/qp2fits.x                      MC 12/3/93
Updated to use 'generic' extension header reader

105.  /pros/xray/xdataio/im2bin                                 MC 12/15/93
Moved from XLOCAL because used by installation scripts

106.  /pros/xray/xdataio/upimgrdf                               MC 12/3/93
Added new task
 
107. /pros/xray/xdataio/rfits2pros.cl                           MC 12/3/93
                        _rfits2pros0.cl
                        _rdffits2pros.cl
                        _errmsg.cl
Made REV0 rfits2pros a subscript and added new RDF
script.  Encoded an error message script, when   
the entire script was too long for the CL    
~
108. /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec.par				MC 12/15/93
Change default value for timenorm=yes.
	Changed back to original timenorm=no			MC 12/16/93
after further consultation

109. /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		DS 12/10/93
Made downspecrdf accept files without FORMAT kaywords.

110.  /pros/xray/xplot/imcontour/imcontour.x, imc_rddata.x      JD 12/17/93
Fixed 'dec' reading from ascii file, freed some space that
wasn't being freed, added check for '+' in ascii file.

111. /pros/xray/xtiming/fft/input_bins.x			MC 12/7/93
/pros/xray/xtiming/fft/
Add new ERRLIB to call.  Also FIT output data columns,
CTRT and NET were interchanged! And be sure BKNORM gets
initialized (to 1.0).

112. /pros/xray/xtiming/fft/get_distrib.x			MC 11/10/93
Output the PWRCUT header parameter in NORMALIZED units

113. /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x			DS 12/17/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/mkpkg
     /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x
     /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/mkpkg
Enabled fit (etc.) and downspecrdf to process FITS release tape spectral 
table files as well as qpspec output files.

114. /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x			DS 12/20/93
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/intermed.x
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/mkpkg
Added "respfile" header parameter to _prd.tab and _int.tab files produced 
by fit.  It gives the name of the response matrix file used.

115. /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x			DVS 12/21/93
Modified ds_getbal and ds_putbal to write out (and read in) table
entries as fractions of time, while using them internally as 
percentages.  Affects Einstein files only.
