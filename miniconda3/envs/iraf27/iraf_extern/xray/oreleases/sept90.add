	A new version of the PROS beta release tape was made on
September 28.

	The files which were changed are as follows:

		./xray/timing/timing.cl
		./xray/timing/timing.hd
		./xray/timing/timing.men
		./xray/timing/mkpkg

		./xray/spectral/source/mkpkg

		./xray/misc/source/mkpkg
		./xray/misc/source/powmin.f

		./xray/misc/misc.cl
		./xray/misc/misc.men

	These changes should allow sites to install PROS at their
own sites, without explicit references to the SAO disk structure.
