    The 3 demos spectraldemo, timingdemo and spatialdemo  will
          run on workstations supporting multiplane image display.
              YOU MUST HAVE AN IMAGE DISPLAY WINDOW OPEN
		( e.g.  IMTOOL or SAOIMAGE )

     The 2 demos gtiming and gspectral will run on terminals only
             supporting line graphics.

     All 5 demos require that you have the `tables' package added
                       to your IRAF installation.
