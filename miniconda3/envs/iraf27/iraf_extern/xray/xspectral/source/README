The following f77 files are part of the spectral source code and are NOT
post-processed files from the SPP processor.  Do not delete these file!:

contour.f gaunt.f powmin.f

Also the files in libextra.a are routines that we must replace some day.  The
f77 files the directory "extra" should not be deleted either.
