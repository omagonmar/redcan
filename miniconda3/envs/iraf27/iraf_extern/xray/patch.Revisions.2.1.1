		PROS patch 2.1.1 for IRAF 2.10

***********************************************************
	The PROS patch was installed in the IRAF account very early 
Friday morning, December 11, including the default response matrix, dtmat_31.
( It required an 'unlearn pkgpars' by the user to activate this new matrix. )
	Due to ROSAT Status report #41, the default response matrix
was corrected Monday, December 14, to revert back to 'dtmat_6.ieee'.
	( dtmat_31.ieee is available by resetting 'pkgpars.ros_dtmat' )

PLEASE VERIFY your PKGPARS.ROS_DTMAT value (lparam pkgpars) to ENSURE you are 
using the appropriate RESPONSE MATRIX.
*************************************************************

1.  The latest PSPC response matrix has been installed: dtmat_31.ieee.
However, status report #41 cites bugs in it's creation.

2.  XEXAMINE has been upgraded.  Please 'unlearn xexamine'.  There
are new user parameters, and a new 's' command has been included that
runs a maximum-likelihood positioning algorithm.

3.  FITS2QP has been fixed to correct a fatal bug reading FITS files
with no 'GTI' records, in particular, Einstein SLEW CDROMS.

4.  Various minor code corrections to support the port to Silicon
Graphics and Decstation machines:
	./xray/lib/coords/coords_eq.f
	./xray/xtiming/timplot/timcoords.x
	./xray/xspatial/detect/bepos/imbepos.x

5.  Many updated HELP files.

6.  QPLIST.PAR correction to allow higher 'display' levels.

7.  IMCNTS correction to allow specification of constant BKGDERR values.

8.  QPLIST - fixed fatal error when the QPOE file was missing the 'title' string.
