M# 
1.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/bal.x					12/28/93   MC
Update library to first check for zero records before failing
on bad format definition.

2.  /pros/xray/xdataio/hkfilter.x				12/28/93   MC
Update routine to use a %.7f format rather than %.2f format
when writing out time filter strings.  We should probably
make this a PARAMETER.

3.  /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/_utmjd.par			12/29/93   WR
Added correct comment characters to parameter file

4.  /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/do_ds.x				1/6/94  DS
    /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x
Changed header parameter card order to improve the chance that 
PROSCON will be able to use downspecrdf's output file.

5.  /pros/xray/xspectral/data/particle_bkgd.tab			1/25/94 DS
Changed comments and table values to match the final published 
version of the Plucinsky et al paper.  This file had been based 
on a preprint; both variable names and values had changed in the 
final paper.

6. /pros/xray/xplot/imcontour/imc_subs.x, imc_legend.x          1/26/94    JD
Updated sprintf calls; in several cases the max string length
was less that the max size of the string, but in 1 case it
was more and reported an error 'ERROR: No write permission on 
file (String_File)'

7. /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/_clc_bary.par			1/26/94    JD
Changed default sec_col default from 'MJF_FRAC' to 'MJD_FRAC'
This shouldn't effect user's since the task hidden and called
from calc_bary.cl with all parameters provided.

8.  /pros/xray/ximages/qplintran/qplintran.x			1/26/94	MC
			qplintran.par
Added 2 new parameters (xdim,ydim) to allow specifying the
output QPOE dimension.  Also fixed problem that XMAG/YMAG
were not applied to the CDELTS.
(proto copy sent to saken/long - stsci.edu)

9.  /pros/xray/xproto/qpwcsedit/qpwcsedit.x			1/26/94 MC
Added XDIM and YDIM parameters as keywords that can be
edited.

10. /pros/xray/xdemo/spatialdemo				1/28/94	MC
	Removed the code to 
		'reset stdgraph'
	because it interferes with XGTERM

11. /pros/xray/xplot/ximtool.cl					1/28/93 MC
	Removed test for TERM to contain 'xterm' substring
because it interferes with XGTERM

12.  /pros/xray/ximages/qplist/qplist.x				2/1/94	MC
	Fix bug # 744 - move the event-destroy-compile
        code INSIDE the if-display-events conditional
	to prevent SEGV.

12a.  /pros/xray/xspatial/vigdata/vigdata.cl			2/1/94	MC
	Remove the non-auto parameter from the procedure call
	died in IRAF 2.10.3 Beta

13. /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/vign_correct.x			2/1/94  DS
In particle_bkgd(): (1) new local variable area_min2, to correct error of
changing value of input parameter area; (2) corrected conversion of area
units from pixels to (arcmin**2); (3) changed variable names, to match
Plucinsky et al paper and comments in file particle_bkgd.tab.

13a. /pros/xray/xspectral/source/bal_histo.x                      2/3/94 DVS
Modified bal_time_warning to not give warning when difference
is under a second.  (Only relevent to Einstein.)

13b. /pros/xray/xspectral/doc/bal_timing.hlp                      2/3/94 DVS
Modified one sentence in help file to make the first case clearer.

14. /pros/xray/xplot/tabplot.cl, tabplot.hlp			2/8/94  JD
Updated tabplot to be compatible with changes in ST sgraph
task.  Tabplot is a sgraph wrapper task.  Also updated help
file.

15. /pros/xray/xtiming/timsort.cl				2/8/94  JD
Changed default eventdef to "" from 'region'.  It will now
inherit the defintion of the input qpoe as default.

16.  /pros/xray/xtiming/qpphase.par				2/8/94  JD
Updated 'eventdef' to include detx/dety and removed dx/dy.
This will allow the output qpoe to be input to qpspec.

17. /pros/xray/xspectral/doc/qpspec.hlp				2/15/94 DS
Made the full description and the example congruent with 
the current release.

18. /pros/xray/xtiming/doc/qpphase.hlp                          2/16/94 JD
Removed PHASE and TPHASE macro references since they don't exist,
included need for time-sorted qpoe for task to run, updated example
to reflect correct order of input parameters and included a timsort
example.

				nextcard.x
Re-did much of the memory allocation, so that memory alloced was correctly
de-alloced.  Fixed some bad calling sequences.  Removed 'knowncards'
definitions from inside the EXTENSION loop.  
All this was motivated by the FATAL/SEGV error in the IRIX (SGI) port
of PROS 2.3.


20.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fitsipc.cards				3/2/94 MC
The special 'OBSERVER' card entry was removed
from qpoeipc.cards and extipc.cards and placed here
due to rewrite in section 19.  This affects only
the Einstein IPC SCREENED event list files, which
were made with an invalid 'OBSERVER' keyword that PROS
needs to trap.
(qpoeipc.card and extipc.cards have now been eliminated)

21.  /pros/xray/doc/filter.hlp					3/9/94 DVS
Revised documentation to show that detx/y,rawx/y,status can be used
as filters.

    /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/mpcspec/mpcspec.x
    /pros/xray/xlocal/einbb/mpcspec/mpcsubs.x
Updated to use RDF-style spectral library and to generate 
RDF-style column headings and units.  (See also Revision #31.)


26.  /pros/xray/xproto/qpcalc/qpcalc.x				3/25/94 MC
			      qpcalcsubs.x
    /pros/xray/xproto/qpcalc.par
    /pros/xray/xproto/doc/qpcalc.hlp
	Completed implementation of qpcalc including help file
and correct history records and GTI updates.

27.  /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/apply_bary/appbary_subs.x	3/25/94 MC
     /pros/xray/lib/pros/times.x
	Moved 'gti_update' routine out of apply_bary and
into PROS library.

28.  /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/qpcmklst.x				3/23/94  MC
     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/evdefsubs.x
     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/eventdef.x
     /pros/xray/xdataio/upqpoerdf.x

	Moved 'upqprdf' routine from QPCREATE library (evdefsubs.x) to UPQPOERDF
task library, since it is RDF specific.  (All its calls are to QPCREATE
routines.)
	Consolidated remaining evdefsubs routines into eventdef.x
	Added qpc_mklst routine (runs from qpcreate.com) for use by QPCALC


29.  /pros/xray/ximages/qplist/qpdisubs.x			3/23/94	MC
     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/evdisubs.x
Moved the 6 datatype versions of the QPLIST/DISPLAY routine
from QPLIST/qpdisubs to QPCREATE library/evdisubs, so
that QPCALC (and any other 'qpcreate' task) can do a debug display
of the event list.

30.  /pros/xray/doc/filter.hlp					3/25/94 MC
     /pros/xray/doc/qpoe.hlp
     /pros/xray/xplot/xdisplay.hlp
Update the 'key' syntax to use real event-attribute names:
	note key=(detx,dety) works instead of the cumbersome
	     key=(s16,s18)
	Also replaced 'dx,dy' references with 'detx,dety'
(or sometimes 'rawx,rawy')

31.  /pros/xray/xspectral/downspecrdf/downspecrdf.x		3/29/94 DS
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dstables.x
     /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dsdisp.x
Added EINSTEIN_MPC case.  (See also Revision #25.)

32.  /pros/xray/xproto/qpcalc/qpcalc.x				3/30/94 MC
	Added error trap for case when new column of
data is requested by not allocated by 'eventdef' parameter.

33.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qpgapmap				3/30/94 JD
	Moved qpgapmap from xproto to xdataio (code,par,help).  
Updated *.cl,*.hd,*.men,x_dataio.x in xdataio with qpgapmap.
Removed qpgapmap from xproto.  Moved RCS files.

34.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qpgapmap/apgap.x			4/6/94	MC
				qpgapmap.x
	Removed print statements and fixed the GAPMAP
indexing which was off by 1 (should have been indexed from zero),
also added insurance that index cannot ever be LESS than 0.
Also fixed typos where X was substitued for Y - nominal
values are =, so there were no erroneous values.

35.  /pros/xray/xdataio/xdataio.cl				4/6/94  JD
     /pros/xray/xdataio/x_xdataio.x
     moved upqpoe.cl to /pros/xray/xdataio/upqpordf.cl
     removed /pros/xray/xdataio/upqpordf.par
     (^^^^^^ important for a patch installation, include in procedure)

Upqpoerdf was updated to run qpgapmap if the instrument is HRI.  
Mo made the changes and I installed and renamed files to make the 
new version available to the user.  Old task became hidden and new
task calls old task and qpgapmap.  

36.  /pros/xray/xlocal/xlocal.cl				4/7/94 DVS

     /pros/xray/lib/zzsetenv.def
Renamed einbb package (in xlocal) to einobsolete.  Created new
subpackage of xlocal called "mpc", and moved mpcspec task from
einobsolete to mpc.

36.  /pros/xray/xdataio/_rdfarc2pros.cl				4/7/94 JD
     /pros/xray/xdataio/_rdffits2pros.cl
Added call to upqpoerdf so that the gapmap is applied and detx/dety 
written out when HRI RDF data is converted.

     /pros/xray/xlocal/mkpkg
     /pros/xray/xlocal/source/mkpkg
"Fixed" bug 730 (which was not as reported, and the fix became a rough 
patch):  Made qpspec report not off-axis angle of center of region but 
mean off-axis angle of counted events, FOR ROSAT INSTRUMENTS ONLY; 
for other instruments it still reports off-axis angle of center of 
region.  The mean off-axis angle of counted events is stored in the 
header of the source off-axis histogram file.

39.  /pros/xray/xspectral/doc/qpspec.hlp			4/8/94	DS
Added brief description of error computation, and more prominent 
reference to "help explain_errors".

--------------------------- IRAFX Build 4/10/94 --------------------------

40.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/xhead.x				4/13/94 MC
Added support for the TLMIN/MAX keywords rather than
TALEN keywords when writing QPHEAD to FITS

41.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/miistruct.x				4/13/94 MC
Added code to miiauxstruct to allow non-aligned entries
within a data record.  Previously had provided for non-aligned
records.  Required because of ASCA/SIS/HOT_PIXELS extension

42.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qp2fits.x				4/13/94 MC
Added 'HOT_PIXELS' as extension name for writing to
output QPOE file - ASCA data/SIS.

43.  /pros/xray/xtiming/fft/get_bins.x				4/13/94 MC
                            bin_source.x
Changed TOTCNTS internal variable to real, and truncate
to integer only when writing to header to avoid accumulated
round-off errors (iprosarc 4/12/94)

44.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qpgapmap/qpgapmap.x			4/13/94 MC
Fixed typo in program name for history record (not qpphase!)

45. /pros/xray/xdemo/gspectral					4/14/94 DVS
Removed "einbb" from gspectral script.

46. /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/get_inst_pars.x			4/25/94 DS
    /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/vign_correct.x
Made BN_OAHAN(), the off-axis histogram angles, always be positive.  
Negative values (due to negative XS-INPXX header parameter in ROSAT HRI 
QPOE file) were causing errors in bn_do_oah().

47. /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/apply_bary.x			4/29/94 JD
Removed prompt for ra/dec, debugged segmentation error. 

48.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/xhead.x				4/20/94 MC
Fixed error return value in x_getb to be boolean and
not int (reported in MAX/AUX port)

49.  /pros/xray/xspatial/errcreate/errcreate.x			4/20/94 MC
Fixed bad declarations/usage of imaccess/streq
(reported in MAC/AUX port)

--------------------------- IRAFX Build 5/1/94 --------------------------

50.  /pros/xray/lib/coords/coord_eq.f				5/2/94 MC
Re-arranged declarations to ensure DATA statements
follow ALL declarations (reported in MAC/AUX port)

51.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/time.x					5/2/94	MC
Made error message string be data-initialized variable to
work around problem that SPP added the character declarations
AFTER the existing DATA statement, preventing portability
to MAC/AUX, for example

52.  /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/persubs.x			5/2/94	MC
Removed t_outtable procedure since it is now obsolete
and uses out of date calling sequences, but produces compile
errors on some systems (MAC/AUX port)

53.  /pros/xray/xspectral/doc/pspc_fitting.hlp			5/2/94	MC
Update dx/dy references with detx/dety and also
update REV1 references with RDF.

54.  /pros/xray/lib/times.x					5/2/94  JD
removed sbuf array in get_timeoff() that was salloc'd, 
but wasn't freed and wasn't used.

Added ecdinfo task to eincdrom package.  Also made old tasks qp_get and
fits_get hidden, since the (soon to be added) task ecd2pros makes them
obsolete.

56   added:						KRM - 5/3/94

58. /pros/xray/lib/pros/xhead.x				MC	5/4/94
			nxhead.x
	Modified get_genwcs to handle both types
of table WCS cases - old format and new format
(with R/S/B possible prefixes).  See prosbug 4/94
	Modified put_genwcs to not write out
ALEN/TLMIN/TLMAX keywords when they have no values.  
These are really only appropriate for 'type=FITS' case.

57. /pros/xray/xdataio/xrfits.cl			MC	5/4/94
	Removed 'rtname' call that was losing user
pros-style extensions.  See prosbug from April 94

    /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/apply_bary/appbary_subs.x
 - Removed ra/dec prompt 

 - When the code has to extrapolate - one statement is written with
   the first time and then the rest are tallied and the count reported.
    
   Previously 1 warning was written for each record.

 - there is a time compatible check in the code ... I added a 60 second   
   tolerance to the check since ephemeris recs are 60 secs in length
   before the warning is issued.  

60. /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/doc/explain_eincdrom.hlp  DVS	5/6/94
   Added new help file which explains package...

--------------------------- IRAFX Build 5/8/94 --------------------------

size of new symbol and inserted missing 'Memc' 

63.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qpappend.x			  MC  	5/12/94
	Added test for OUTPUT 'NTSI' header parameter
when updating the auxiliary records.  (Reported on ASCA data)

64.  /pros/xray/xplot/imcontour/imc_rddata.x		  JD	5/15/94
	Updated alloc of buffer badrow with a calloc instead of 
salloc to init space to 0.  Fixes bug report that sometimes sources
were skipped when input list is ascii.

--------------------------- IRAFX Build 5/15/94 -------------------------

65.  /pros/xray/xspectral/source/dsebounds.x		  MC	5/17/94

    /pros/xray/lib/regions/mkpkg
Eliminated any restrictions on source regions for qpspec (and removed the 
"extended" task parameter and stopped writing and reading the "POINT" file 
header parameter).  
Corrected the Einstein IPC point source region check.  
Changed region descriptor processing to provide prompt feedback about 
syntactic or semantic errors in region descriptors provided to qpspec.

67.  /pros/xray/xtiming/qpphase/qpphase.x		  MC	5/19/94
	Changed history print format from float to exponential

68.  /pros/xray/xtiming/fft/get_distrib.x		  MC	5/19/94

just after in had been normalized.

69.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/im_mpe_head.x		  MC	5/20/94
	Add extra dummy header card to recover missing 'CTYPE1'
card that was getting dropped - only for REV0/MPE image files - soon
to be obsolete

70.  /pros/xray/xspectral/hxflux.cl			JD  	5/20/94

updated pi channels for soft/hard/broad, added RDF maxpha, minpha
keyword inputs.  

72.  /pros/xray/xdataio/_rdfrall.cl			JD   	5/26/94
	Replaced printf with print statement.

73.  /pros/xray/xdataio/rfits2pros.cl			JD    	5/26/94
	Wasn't running upqpoerdf for rev 0 data.  Found that when 
autoname can't be used for REV0 since IRAFNAME doesn't exist in the
header to use as a default name.  Upqpoerdf got a null file name to 
write to...I forced autoname=no when _rfits2pros0 was called.

74.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_mpe_head.x           MC      5/27/94
        Fixed calling sequence for UT->MJD.  Needs a QPHEAD
handle not a QP handle.  Caused error in SUB-INST as well, which
is selected by time.

-------------------------- IRAFX/P Build 5/29/94 ------------------------

	Added demonstration task to EINCDROM package.

77. /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/eincdrom.cl		DVS	6/1/94
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/ObsoleteFiles

     deleted:
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_qp_get.cl
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_qp_get.par
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_fits_get.cl

    added:

    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_qp_get_obs.par
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_fits_get_obs.cl
    /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/_fits_get_obs.par

	Added "_obs" extension to _qp_get and _fits_get tasks to
show that they are obsolete and to fix an annoying name conflict
bug between _fits_get and _fitsnm_get.

78. /pros/xray/xdataio/qpgapmap/qpgapmap.x		JD	6/6/94
    updated OPTAXIS X & Y to recentered position in the
    header.  For rev0 data only, input taken from the
    parameter file.

79. /pros/xray/xspectral/xflux/xflux.x			JD 	6/8/94
    fixed typo in the parameter 'delleration_constant' 
    to 'deceleration_constant' in the code, par file, and
    help file.

80. /pros/xray/ximages/qphedit/qphedit.x,qphedit.par    JD      6/8/94
    changed parameter 'images' to 'qpoes'. Updated code
    and par file.  DVS gave the help an overhall.

81. /pros/xray/xspatial/makevig/vignsub.x		JD      6/8/94
    fixed VAX error - Added assignment of colptr to TY_DOUBLE,  
    it seems this should be in the tables code, but I couldn't
    find it in the open (tbtopn) or column init routine (tbcfnd).
    When the next routine (tbcgtd) is called it expects to know
    the data type, and doesn't have it.

82. /pros/xray/lib/tbset.h				JD      6/8/94
    removed tbset.h from /pros/xray/lib.  This local copy should
    not be there since tables is released by IRAF.  Don't think
    there was a conflict yet, it didn't match the table version of
    this file, but the new one had additions only.

    Updated help files; many of these simply had new eventdef declarations,
    others were out of date, and others needed to have parts rewritten.
