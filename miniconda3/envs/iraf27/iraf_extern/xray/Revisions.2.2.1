# jd timing updates.

1.  /pros/xray/xtiming/ltcurv.x					JD  5/27/93
    /pros/xray/xtiming/fold.x
    /pros/xray/xtiming/period.x
    /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/persubs.x
    /pros/xray/xtiming/fft/input_bins.x

Put tim_cktime call immediately after the qpoe open.  If the file is not
in time-order the user will know right after the filename input (ltcurv, 
fold, period).   FFT a step closer but not complete, would take restructuring
of several routines. 

2. /pros/xray/xspatial/doc/rosprf.hlp				JSO 6/10/93

Corrected usage lines.

3. /pros/xray/lib/scan/scpool.x					DS 6/15/93
Removed pointer type declaration of procedures sc_freeedge() & sc_fillpool().

4. /pros/xray/lib/pros/getplims.x				DS 6/17/93
Changed reference to streq() to the correct type (bool, not int).

5. /pros/xray/xtiming/timlib/fld_phots.x			JD 6/22/93
Changed an && statement to 2 statements to accomodate the way the 
DEC station evaluates these conditionals.  Also fixed bug reported 
by M. Garcia by initializing the src and bkgd counts to 0 when 
entering the routine (tim_srcbin, tim_bkbin).  An old value was being 
remembered when the task was run >1 time. 

6.  /pros/xray/xproto/source/qpmax.x				MC 7/2/93
			     qpproj.x
			     qppower.x
Removed explicit pathnames!

7.  /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/qpcreate_subs.x
Fixed logic to correctly update ONTIME when copying		MC 7/2/93
into a QPOE file with no 'time' (therefore no deffilt)
(also for correctly updating deffilt in apply_bary)

8.  /pros/xray/lib/pros/xhead.x					MC 7/2/93
Added new routine fix_pspc() to force correct
ROSAT/PSPC sub-instrument setting.
