	'initialize uparm?' question.

non-SUN support
---------------
	This patch contains fixes for all our platform ports.  We
	have included entries for additional architectures in
	our 'mkpkg' file.  We have explicitly ported, or our sites
	have ported, to the following architectures:

	VAX/VMS	(using IRAF 2.10/Beta release)
	Decstation/ULTRIX (ddec,dsux)
	IBM RS6000	  (rs6000)
	Silicon Graphics  (irix)

	We now expect that PROS should work on any of the other supported
	IRAF architectures without further problems.


XIMAGES
-------
	QPCOPY/QPSORT/TIMSORT
	Fixed a a bug, that caused the 'ONTIME' quantity NOT to be
	updated when creating an output QPOE file without
	the 'time' attribute (e.g. EVENTDEF = small or peewee)

XTIMING
---------
	Up-to-date versions of the corrections tables for both
	Einstein and ROSAT barycenter timing corrections have
	been included.  Invalid versions were inadvertently included
	in the PROS 2.2 release.  Due to format changes, these
	invalid versions produced FATAL errors, so there was no
	problem with producing erroneous results.

	Checks added in most routines to verify input is time-ordered.
	These tasks now give a FATAL error when encountering input that is 
	NOT time-sorted.

 
        LTCURV 
	Corrected a bug that appeared in the Decstation port
	that caused the output source counts to differ from the number 
	of photons in the input file. 


XSPECTRAL
---------
	QPSPEC 
	Modified to give a warning rather than a fatal
	error if input file is not spatially sorted and indexed.
	(This check is due to an IRAF-bug that often causes a FATAL 
	error when running on a non-sorted input file.)

XDATAIO
-------
	RARC2PROS 
	It has come to our attention that not all GERMAN/PSPC files	
	in the ROSAT archive include a 'sub-instrument' identifier.
	In this case PROS was defaulting to sub-instrument = 1 (or
	PSPCC), which was usually incorrect.   PROS has now been
	modified to select the sub-instrument based on OBSERVATION
	DATE (MJD-OBS), with all observations in 1990 being 
	assigned to sub-insrument=1 (PSPCC) and all observations
	in 1991 and later to sub-instrument=2 (PSPCB).

	To correct existing QPOE files in PROS:
		qphedit <filename>.qp XS-SUBIN 2  
	or for existing tables in PROS,especially any *_obs.tab produced 
	by QPSPEC:
		tupar <filename>_obs.tab
		:r SUBINST 
		keyword SUBINST, type i; give replacement value:
		1
		2
		Current parameter and its replacement are:
		SUBINST  i 1
		SUBINST  i 2
		   ...   OK to replace ? (yes): 
		:e

		
MOTD
----
	With the initial release of PROS 2.2, several sites reported
	error messages when loading XRAY packages:
	ERROR: no such parameter - 'motd'

	This error was in fact caused by an error in the TABLES
	package installation.  PROS packages automatically load
	the TABLES packages using the new 'motd-' parameter to
	suppress the header banner.  If TABLES was not defined
	correctly in the IRAF/extern.pkg, this new parameter
	was not recognized.  The correct definition for TABLES is
		task tables.pkg = tables$tables.cl
	WITHOUT using a '$' in the task definition name.

	Also, it is REQUIRED that TABLES 1.2.3 be installed and
	that the command 'unlearn tables' is performed.
	

XLOCAL
------
	Removed the explicit pathnames from the source code, and
	removed the sub-packages not required by remote sites.
	This package will be reorganized for the next release.

FUTURE PLANS
-----------
	There will be a further PROS patch - 2.2.2 - later this
summer to support the new RDF FITS files that will soon be produced
by ALL the ROSAT Science Data Center Processing Systems.
