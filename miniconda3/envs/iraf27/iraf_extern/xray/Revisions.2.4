1.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ftwcs.h				6/28/94	MC
			       ft_nxtext.x
Fix the problem converting 'rotated' FITS files
to QPOE.  a)  CROTA structure variable was int not double
b)  CROTA is stored as DEGREES in FITS - need to be radians
for mwcs

2.  /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/fits2qp.h			6/30/94	MC

   /pros/xray/xdataio/wcs.cards		
	Updated FITS2QP to accept input BINTABLE WCS/CD
rotation matrices as well as TCDLT and TCTOT keywords

3.  /pros/xray/xdataio/qp2fits/qp2fits.x			6/30/94 MC
    /pros/xray/xdataio/qp2fits.par			
Modified qp2fits to accept paramter 'newwcs' to
specify whether BINTABLE/EVENTS WCS to be specified
with TCDLT/TCROT keywords or rotation matrix: TCDaa_bb

4.  /pros/xray/lib/qpoe.h					6/30/94 MC
    /pros/xray/lib/pros/parsewcs.x
			qpwcs.x

    /pros/xray/xspatial/xspatial.men
    /pros/xray/xspatial/xspatial.hd
    /pros/xray/xspatial/mkpkg

Added eintools subpackage under xspatial.


6.  /pros/xray/xspectral/upspecrdf/upspecrdf.x			7/7/94 DS
Added Einstein MPC case.

8. /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/mkpkg			       7/15/94 DVS
   /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/tables/mkpkg

Eincdrom now uses a libgentab.a library to manipulate tables.  This
library consists of the routines in the "tables" subdirectory.

9.  /pros/xray/ext.h						7/15/94 JD
    /pros/xray/lib/pros/fnames.x		

Added EXT_ANG and EXT_OBI extensions for evalvg.

10. /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary/clcbary_subs.x		7/15/94 JD
    /pros/xray/lib/bary.h

Added the last 2 leap seconds (Jul 1 93, Jul-1-94) to the 
data statement list of leap seconds.  Updated NLEAPS in
bary.h from 17 to 19.  

11. /pros/xray/xproto/evalvg/evalvg.x                           7/21/94 JCC

Add the new task EVALVG to xray.xproto. 

12. /pros/xray/xdataio/_rdfrarc2pros.cl				7/25/94 JD

Fixed stridx call when piecing together the mex.pl file name.
Substituded 'x' for '.imh'+2.  Found that '.imh' was an 'or' search
on each letter.

13. /pros/xray/xdataio/eincdrom/data/slew_info.tab		7/26/94 DVS

Revised slew table to have extension column filled with the character
'd' instead of the space character ' '.  This works around the bug that
stwfits and strfits will strip that space [leaving an empty string],
causing ecdinfo to think the table is missing the extension column.

14. /pros/xray/xspatial/imcnts/imcnts.x				7/27/94 JD
Added debug>=5 statements to get some output to debug
Ginevra's problem with the task.  Found it was the imaccess
call in 'cnt_bstype'.  Didn't work at her site running
IRAF 2.10.1 ... recompiled xspatial with -z and copied
the exe to her site.

15.  /pros/xray/xproto/qpcreate.cl				7/27/94 JD
Fixed a missing quote, "NONE ---> "NONE"

    /pros/xray/lib/pros/tsi.x
    /pros/xray/ximages/qplist/qplist.x

Added capability to display Einstein Rev 1 TSI records in qplist.

18. /pros/xray/ximages/doc/qplist.hlp				8/4/94 DVS

Modified help file to mention that the "tsi" parameter will display
Einstein as well as Rosat TSI records.

19. /pros/xray/xdataio/xrfits.cl				8/4/94 DVS

Fixed stdout display in XRFITS script: extra "with" removed.

    /pros/xray/xspectral/source/bal_histo.x
    /pros/xray/xspectral/xspectral.hd

  deleted: /pros/xray/xspectral/doc/bal_timing.hlp

Modified task QPSPEC to use QPOE deffilt and on-line filtering when creating
BAL histogram for Einstein IPC QPOE files.  Removed bal_time_warning
routine (and hence bal_timing help file) since this code change makes
the help file & warning message obsolete.   
    
21. /pros/xray/xspatial/imcnts/imcnts.x				8/12/94 JD

Fixed imcnts to accept a "" for the background file and use the same 
file that was specified for the source.  This was working when the input 
was an image file, but not when the input was a qpoe with blocks and filters 
(they were stripped) and the bk usually came up 0.

Also changed the name buffers in the code (about 10 of them) that were 
declared character arrays of SZ_PATHNAME, to pointer and memory allocated 
space.  Space is freed when the task completes.  A no-op to the user, 
but hopefully better code.

     /pros/xray/xspatial/eintools/ [directory]

Added eintools package under xspatial.  [It didn't make PROS 2.3.1 release,
but it does have the same revisions number --22!-- as in the last Revisions
file!]

     /pros/xray/xspatial/improj/improj.x
     /pros/xray/xlocal/source/qppower.x
Corrected failure to handle WCS in improj and qppower.  In the process 
did minor restructuring of the interface of tasks to the regions system 
through rg_create() (for details see rgcreate.x).

24. /pros/xray/xlocal/source/qppower.x				8/23/94  JD
Updated QPPOWER to read the QPOE header and access ONTIME 
through the structure.  This level of abstraction was added 
to all tasks last fall, this one in xlocal was missed.  
It was looking for "XS-ONTIME" which is outdated with RDF.

25. *deleted* /pros/xray/xspatial/phadst <<< an empty directory 8/23/94  JD

26. /pros/xray/xlocal/mpc/mpc.hd				9/6/94	KRM
Added pointers to the help files for the external MPCTOOLS package which were
installed in the /pros/xray/xlocal/mpc/doc directory.  These files include
get_htrc.hlp, get_spec.hlp and using_mpctools.hlp.

27. /pros/xray/xlocal/mpc/mpc_motd				9/6/94	KRM
Added an advertisement about the MPCTOOLS package and a pointer to the related
help files to the mpc message of the day.

28. /pros/xray/xspatial/xspatial.hd				9/7/94  DVS
    /pros/xray/xspatial/eintools/eintools.hd
Fixed help database files to stop "bad file type `' in helpdir" errors in 
mkhelpdb.  

29. /pros/xray/xspatial/eintools/source/bkmap.x			9/8/94  DVS
Changed "pirange" to "pi_range" to be consistent with other routines.
(This removes the "Warning: identifier mapping not unique" when compiling.)

30. /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/do_ds.x				9/8/94  DS
Corrected error introduced with use of put_tbhead() in PROS 2.3:
LIVETIME header parameter in the table files is restored to reflecting
the gti's in the time-filtered input .qp file, instead of being just a
copy of LIVETIME in the .qp file.

31. /pros/xray/xspectral/upspecrdf/upspecrdf.x			9/9/94  DS
Corrected handling of POISSERR keyword:  If it's not present in the 
original file, it's reset ("F"), because pre-RDF _obs.tab files have 
Gaussian error estimates.

32. /pros/xray/xspatial/simevt					9/9/94  JD/KRM
    /pros/xray/xspatial/srcechk
    /pros/xray/xspatial/simtab.cl				
    /pros/xray/xspatial/qpsim.cl
Installed new task to create simulated event-list data (qpsim ) and
task to create the input source list from a ascii list (simtab).  


33. /pros/xray/xtiming/data/scc_to_utc.tab			9/16/94 JD

    /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_mii.x   <---- NEW FILE

Modified FITS2QP in two ways:
  * Now handles TSCAL/TZERO extension keywords in FITS files by applying
    the scales/offsets to the appropriate columns, promoting types as
    necessary.
  * Allows the user to specify which columns in the event definition
    should be considered 'x' and 'y' in the QPOE file.

  These changes necessitated changes elsewhere throughout the PROS code
  which made improper assumptions.  (For instance, auxiliary records &
  event records might no longer have every column properly aligned,
  since some column type might have been promoted.)

35.     /pros/xray/xspatial/srcinten.cl				9/19/94 JD/JC
Installed NEW task srcinten that computes the count rate of a source.

36.	/pros/xray/lib/pros/tsi.x				9/21/94 DVS
Modified disp_etsi to correctly display (and not bomb out) the inter-
observatory gap in TSI records when given two IPC event QPOEs which have
been QPAPPENDed together.

37.     /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_nxtext.x			9/30/94 DVS
Modified FITS2QP to only write out unknown header cards to QPOE if we are
in the main header or the events header.

38. /pros/xray/xspectral/qpspec/bn_routines.x			10/3/94 DS
Corrected error in bn_off_axis():  Formerly used QP_CDELT1(shead) for 
degrees per pixel for computing DS_MEAN_EVENT_OFFAXIS_ANGLE(ds); 
corrected to use QP_INPXX(shead).

	/pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_typedef.x
	/pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/fits2qp.h
Modified FITS2QP to correctly apply TSCAL/TZERO on extensions with
columns which contain an array of values.  Also modified FITS2QP to
not be so picky as to force the final index number to match the number
of fields in an extension.  (I.e., if an extension has 8 columns, and
TFIELD is set to 8, we can have "TUNIT5" as the final header card.)

42.     /pros/xray/xdataio/doc/fits2qp.hlp			2/17/95 DVS
Fixed minor typo in help file.

43.     /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_typedef.x			2/23/95 DVS
Fixed bug in ft_typedef.x which occured when a TSCAL/TZERO was 
applied on an array of values.

44.     /pros/xray/xproto/qpcalc/qpcalc.x			2/23/95 MC
Changed ev_osize call to ev_size call now that DVS has 
rationalized these algorithms in eventdefs.

45.     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/qpclookup.x			2/23/95 MC
Fixed this call to convert the 0, non-0 return from ev_lookuplist, 
into simple NO/YES return - which is what tasks expected.
(ev_lookuplist claimed to return NO/YES but doesn't really)

46.     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/eventdef.x			2/23/95 MC
Changed documentation on the ev_lookuplist routine to correctly 
reflect that this routine returns a non-0 value for YES, 
but NOT exactly =1.

47.     /pros/xray/xproto/qpcreate.cl                           5/4/95 JCC
Added new parameters (xkey, ykey) for updated FITS2QP

Added PSPC light curve tables. 
Updated to allow users to specify an output filename when autoname="no".
Added the condition checking for "No FITS files found".
Removed unnecessary "scan" that was used twice in one pipe line.
Updated the help file for rarc2pros.

53.     /pros/xray/xplot/pspc_hrcolor.cl                       5/23/95 JCC
Updated to accept PSPCB or PSPCC as header keyword INSTRUME.

54.     /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/qpc_subs.x->qpc_subs_nouse.x   5/23/95 JCC
It is not used in pros, renamed to ./lib/qpcreate/qpc_subs_nouse.x 

55.     /pros/xray/xdataio/qpappend/qpc_subs.x                 5/26/95 JCC
Converted QP_MJDRDAY from "integer" to "double" before calling 
"fp_equald".  Also updated to use "pargi" instead of "pargd" 
for QP_MJDRDAY output.

56.	/pros/xray/xtiming/ksplot.cl			       6/5/95  JCC
Updated with new IGI parameters. 

57.     /pros/xray/xdataio/rarc2pros.cl                        6/8/95  JCC
Fixed the problem described in hp14 : "wp*.fits should not be

58.     /pros/xray/xdataio/_rdfarc2pros.cl                     6/12/95 JCC
Updated to check whether both of the pixel file(*.pix) and the

And no need to reproduce other tables after pl file created.

59.	/pros/xray/xproto/doc/qpcreate.hlp		       6/12/95 JCC
Added the description for new parameters xkey & ykey.

60.	/pros/xray/xspatial/doc/srcinten.hlp		       6/13/95 JCC
Updated with Frank's comments.
	/pros/xray/xspatial/xspatial.cl
Added the new task srcinten in the xspatial package.
	/pros/xray/xspatial/srcinten.cl

dmip_wlsetup.x not used.

63:     /pros/xray/ximages/qplintran/qplintran.x               6/28/95 JCC
display xdim/ydim when >=2 and use INDEFI for XDIM/YDIM. 
        /pros/xray/ximages/doc/qplintran.hlp
xdim/ydim should be described as integer type.
        /pros/xray/ximages/qpshift.cl
add xdim & ydim for qplintran.
        /pros/xray/doc/qpmerge.hlp
Fixed typos.

Updated qpshift and qplintran to fix the problem in QPAPPEND
when merging a shifted qpoe file. Now a shifted qpoe file
can be either from QPSHIFT or from QPLINTRAN.  WCSQPEDIT
(or QPHEDIT) is no longer needed to set AXLEN1 and AXLEN2
back to the appropriate value.

62.    /pros/xray/xplot/tvgrid.cl -->tvgrid_nouse.cl           7/5/95  JCC
tvgrid.cl not used and renamed to tvgrid_nouse.cl.

       /pros/xray/xspatial/doc/srcinten.hlp
Update example in SRCINTEN help file to show higher display level.

64.    /pros/xray/xspatial/detect/doc/ldetect.hlp              7/11/95   JCC
Description of region parameter says BKDEN radius is in arc-sec.
It's actually in arc-min. (fap)

65,    /pros/xray/xplot/newwcslab/wcslab.x                     7/95   JCC
       /pros/xray/xplot/newwcslab/wlwcslab.x
Replaced with latest IRAF2.10.4 routines.

66.   /pros/xray/xdataio/fits2qp/ft_mwcs.x                     7/95   DVS
Tried to fix the problem caused by iraf2.10.4/MWCS - 
but still having bug. Good try !

67.    /pros/xray/xdataio/qpappend/mkpkg                       8/3/95 JCC
Copy qpcreate.x from /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate.x to qpappend/.
and add the line qpcreate to mkpkg to recompile it. Otherwise
VAX/VMS links qpc_isqpoe from wrong place (xray/lib/qpcisqpoe.x).
The correct qpc_isqpoe used by qpappend should be from
"xdataio/qpappend/qpc_subs.x".

68.   /pros/xray/xspatial/srcechk/x_srcechk.x                  8/7/95 JCC
Delete this file ( task  srcechk = t_srcechk ).
"task srcechk" has been defined in /pros/xray/xspatial/x_xspatial.x/

69.   /pros/xray/lib/vvms/timfilter.x
      /pros/xray/lib/mkpkg.sf.VMS
Copy /pros/xray/xtiming/timfilter/timfilter.x to ./xray/lib/vvms/. and
modified it for VAX/VMS version.

70.  /pros/xray/lib/qpcreate/uhead2qp.x				8/8/95 DVS
 Added lines to set QP_INDEXX and QP_INDEXY to default values
 of 'x' and 'y'. This allows programs which read from UHEADs
 (such as xpr2qp) to have indices automatically set.  This is
 necessary for QPOE creation.

71.  /pros/xray/xinstall/calr_fits2qp.cl                       8/28/95 JCC
     /pros/xray/xinstall/calr_qp2fits.cl
Add rparlac_00b.fits/rparlac_00b.qp back to the scripts for pros2.4. 

72. /pros/xray/xinstall/drep2cal.cl                            9/7/95 JCC
Add more data files to copy.

73. /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary/clcbary_subs.x         9/18/95 JCC
    /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary/calc_bary.x
    /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary/jdleap_init.x (new)
The data "jdleap[NLEAPS]" are no longer hardwired in the codes.  
Instead, it is stored in a new table "jdleap.tab". When adding 
a leap second, no need to update the header file and to
recompile the codes anymore. Just simply create another new 
table "jdleap.tab" will make it work. Two new parameters:
"jdleap[50] + NLEAPS" are passed to "ss_bar, ephem & a1utcf ".
    /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary/mkpkg
Add the new code "jdleap_init.x" to compile.
    /pros/xray/lib/bary.h
Remove NLEAPS and add new LEAPMAX (=50). It only affects
the task "calc_bary".
    /pros/xray/xtiming/timcor/calc_bary.cl
Add a new parameter for jdleap.tab when calling _clc_bary 

74.  /pros/xray/xinstall/fits2ephem.cl                         9/20/95 JCC
Updated to add a new calibration file "jdleap.tab".

75.  /pros/xray/xinstall/xinstall.men                          9/20/95 JCC
Added the description for each task in xinstall.

     /pros/xray/xspatial/xspatial.cl                           9/27/95 JCC 
     /pros/xray/xspatial/doc/srcinten.hlp 
Added to load the package xspectral.
Arcminutes can't be used in the region descriptor.  It causes 
a problem to tcreate when writing an output table.

77.  /pros/xray/xdataio/rarc2pros.cl                           10/2/95 JCC
     /pros/xray/xdataio/_rarc2pros0.cl
rarc2pros - The msg "*fits not found" is limited to RDF data.
_rarc2pros0 - when clob+, imdelete *.imh for wh*_events.mt
