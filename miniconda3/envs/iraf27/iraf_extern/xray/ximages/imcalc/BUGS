		KNOWN BUGS, FEATURES, POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

1) Mathematical functions trap with "bus error", when getting incorrect
input, i.e., sqrt(-n), etc. This needs to be trapped globally and a soft
reset done to restart the calculator.

2) Register record has extra padding because of alignment problem with
double and complex values.

3) Some math (trig, etc.) functions coerce complex to double.
Is this acceptable?

4) 1 x N sections are treated like N x 1 sections by imio.  Thus, one
cannot write a single column of data.

5) Only tested on OIF files, not on ST files.  In particular, never
tested using 2 bracket specifications.

6) Untested on images >= 4 dimensions.

7) The parser has some trouble distinguishing the directory "/" from the
divide operator "/".  In particular, operands must be separated by spaces
from the "/" operator.  Also, if the "/" directory is first in an image
name, that image must be enclosed in quotes.
