This package is in transition; the old tasks qp_get and fits_get are
being replaced by the improved tasks ecdinfo and ecd2pros.  We hope that
if this transition works well, we can remove all obsolete files.  These
obsolete files include:

  _cp_wo_attr/*   : used to copy files; no longer needed
		****NOTE**** The task _cp_wo_attr IS needed by ecd2pros
	 	under versions of IRAF before IRAF 2.10.3.  Please
	        don't delete before IRAF 2.10.3 is required for the 
		release version of PROS.  Note also that when this
	   	is deleted, the eincdrom task _ein_copy	will have to be 
		updated to make calls to "copy" in place of "_cp_wo_attr".
 
  _fits_find/*    : used in qp_get/fits_get to find FITS file on CD.
                    replaced by ecdinfo.

  _fitsnm_get/*   : used in qp_get/fits_get to convert a specifier to
		    a FITS name.  Better version in ecdinfo.

  _spec2root/*    : used in qp_get/fits_get to get a root name from a
                    specifier.  New version in ecd2pros.

  _qp_get_obs.cl  : (was qp_get)
  _qp_get_obs.par
  _fits_get_obs.cl : (was fits_get)
  _fits_get_obs.par
  doc/qp_get.hlp
  doc/fits_get.hlp : no longer needed

  eincdpar.par    : remove index files; only used in qp_get & fits_get

  source/dataset2index.x:  used by qp_get/fits_get to convert datasets
                    into indices; we no longer need to do so in ecdinfo,
                    since datasets are referenced by datatype & instrument.

  source/ecd_err.h:  remove errors < 300; only used by qp_get & fits_get

  source/dataset.h:  remove EOSCAT_LINES_TO_SKIP and SZ_DATASET; not needed.

  x_eincdrom.x:  remove references to cp_wo_attr, fits_find,
		    fitsnm_get, and spec2root.  

  

This should be enough to remove all obsolete references to qp_get & fits_get.
