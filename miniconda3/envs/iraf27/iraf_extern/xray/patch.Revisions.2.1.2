	New features in PROS patch 2.1.2 - 3/22/93
        ----------------------------------------------
 	
XSPECTRAL
---------
	The latest PSPC detector response matrix and off-axis area file
from MPE have been installed and are now the DEFAULT value in 'pkgpars'.  
(These files: dtmat_36, offar2_6, offar1_6, are equivalent to
the 93jan12 file in XSPEC).  Additionally, the default channels to fit 
have been changed from 2:34, to 3:34.  The parameters and values are:
	ros_dtmat = "xspectraldata$dtmat_36.ieee"
	ros_offar = "xspecraldata$offar2_6.ieee"
	ros_pspc_cha = "3:34"
Please 'unlearn pkgpars' to activate this.
The previous versions of the calibration files are still available and
can be recalled by users, if desired, by resetting the above parameters.


XDATAIO
-------
	RARC2PROS 
		This is a new script task to convert files retrieved from
	the ROSAT archive to PROS format.  It recognises either US or
	MPE format files and does all the necessary conversions
	(including a QPSORT) that are required by PROS.  In addition
	the WCS parameters in the header are edited to correct the
	~1 pixel error problem in the original FITS files.
	
	RFITS2PROS
		Support has been added for additional files for PSPC:
	EVRAT file (file 18) and the Aspect Quality (file 25).  If they
	have been retrieved from tape and are available in the 
	directory a *_evr.tab file and/or a *_qlt.tab file will be
	produced containing this info.  (To retrieve them, just add
	the above file numbers to the list when running 't2d')
	These can be examined using the usual TABLES tasks, such
	as TPRINT,SGRAPH, etc.
