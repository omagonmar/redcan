onedspec/deblend.x

    (2/25/02, Valdes)

sptmodel.x
sptmodel.par
    The modnsub parameter is now visible in the parameter set though there
    is no GUI control.  This is to allow using very small LFWHM constraints.

sptmodel.x
    A return argument in the call to voigt was a type coerced variable.
    Replaced with a variable of the right type and added an error check
    against a divide by zero.  (2/17/03, Valdes)

	selected which does not currently exist it is created.
