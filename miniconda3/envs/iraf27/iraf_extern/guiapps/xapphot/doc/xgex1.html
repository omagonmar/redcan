<H2>TUTORIAL I. USING XGUIPHOT TO DISPLAY AND EXAMINE IMAGES</H2>
<P>

The purpose of tutorial I is to show users how to use the xguiphot task to
quickly select, display, and examine the input image list with a view to 
making photometric measurements.
<P>

To being the tutorial type the following at the cl prompt:
<P>
<PRE>
    cl&gt; xgex1
</PRE>
<P>
After the gui is activated the first image in the input list, gcluster.fits,
is displayed in the image display window, and the gui is ready for user input.
<P>

The tutorial is intented to be executed in sequence.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.1. THE STATUS LINE MARKER</H2>
<P>

Examine the botton of the image display window. You should see the following
message 
<P>
<PRE>
    Warning: image xapphot$data/gcluster.fits keyword: FILTERS 
    not found
</PRE>
<P>
highlighted in turquoise in the bottom "<TT>line</TT>" of the image display window.
This region of the image display window is called the status line. It is
used to print error messages,  warning messages, status reports, and
quick-look results. This particular message means that xguiphot searched for
and failed to find the keyword FILTERS in the header of
xapphot$data/gcluster.fits. Ignore the content of the warning message for
now.
<P>

Move the mouse to the image display window and type CR. Examine
the status line again. What happened ? The CR is an example of an accelerator
keystroke whose function is to clear the status line. The same function 
can be performed less efficiently by moving to the Results menu and
selecting the "<TT>Clear status line</TT>" item.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.2. THE FILES MARKER</H2>
<P>

Examine the box in the upper left corner of the image display window. This
box is called the files marker and it displays the current image name,
the current input objects file, the results file logging status, and
the current output results file. Note that results file logging is turned off.
<P>

To move the files marker to a different location:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the files marker
    2. wait until the marker highlights and the cursor changes
       shape to a small cross
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. drag the marker to a different position
    5. release the left mouse button
</PRE>
<P>

To resize the files marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the lower right corner of the files marker
    2. wait until the marker highlights and the cursor changes
       shape to a small box with arrows
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. drag the marker corner slightly upward and to the left
    5. release the left mouse button
<P>
</PRE>
<P>

To delete the files marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the files marker
    2. wait until the marker highlights and the cursor changes
       shape to a small cross
    3. hit the Delete key 
       or
    3. press the right mouse button
    4. select the "Dismiss marker" item
</PRE>
<P>

To redisplay the files marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button 
    2. move to the Options submenu
    3. select the "Show files marker" item
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.3. THE COORDINATES MARKER</H2>
<P>

Examine the box in the lower right hand corner of the image display window.
This is the coordinates marker. The coordinates marker displays the
image pixel coordinates of the mouse when it is in the image display window.
Move the mouse around the image display window. What happens to the
displayed coordinates ?
<P>

The coordinates marker can be moved, resized, and deleted in the same
manner as the files marker. To redisplay the coordinates marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button 
    2. select the Options submenu
    3. select the "Show coords marker" item from the options submenu
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.4. THE CROSSHAIR CURSOR</A></H2>
<P>

The default image display window cursor is a small circle. In some cases
the cross-hair cursor may be more useful. To change the default
cursor from circle to cross-hair and vice versa:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    2. select the Options submenu
    3. select the "Show crosshair" item
       or
    3. select the "Dismiss crosshair" item
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.5. ZOOMING, PANNING, AND WINDOWING WITH THE MOUSE</H2>
<P>

By default the xguiphot image display code fills the viewport in the
largest image dimension while preserving the aspect ratio.
<P>

To zoom in:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the image display
    2. click twice on the middle mouse button
</PRE>
<P>

To zoom out:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the image display
    2. click twice on the middle mouse button while holding down
       the Shift key
</PRE>
<P>

To return to the original display:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the image display
    2. click once on the middle mouse button while holding down
       the Control key
</PRE>
<P>

To pan the image:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the image display
    2. click once  on the middle mouse button
</PRE>
<P>

To window the image display:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse into the image display
    2. press down on the right mouse button while moving the mouse
      in the image display window
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.6. USING CURSOR MODE WITH THE IMAGE DISPLAY WINDOW</H2>
<P>

The xguiphot image display window is a gterm widget, i.e. the same widget
used by the IRAF xgterm and ximtool programs. Therefore the xguiphot image
display window and all the other xguiphot graphics windows, support with
a few caveats, full IRAF cursor mode. This means that it is possible to zoom,
pan, expand the display, make snaps (but see below), etc using the default
IRAF cursor keystroke commands, just as one can for any standard IRAF task.
<P>

The most useful cursor keys are the following:
<P>
<PRE>
C     # Print coordinates at position of cursor
E,E   # Expand the plot
M     # Pan
P     # Zoom out
Z     # Zoom in
0     # Reset and redraw
</PRE>
<P>

Users should be aware that the simple = and :.snap commands do not currently
work properly for the image display window. A workaround 
is being prepared for this. The = and :.snap do work correctly
from all the xguiphot vector graphics windows.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.7. MAKING HARDCOPIES OF THE IMAGE DISPLAY WINDOW</H2>
<P>

This facility is not yet supported.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.8. BROWSING THE IMAGE LIST</A></H2>
<P>

To browse the image list sequentially either:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    2. select the "Next image" or "Previous image" items
</PRE>
<P>
or simply
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type n or p keystroke commands to move forwards or backwards
       through the image list
</PRE>
<P>
Note that as each image is displayed the file marker and status line
are automatically updated. When is the coordinates marker updated ?
<P>

To determine the sequence number of the current image:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type ":imnumber" follwed by CR
</PRE>
<P>
The current image number will be printed in the status line marker. Try it.
<P>

To redisplay the first image in the input image list:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type ":imnumber 1" follwed by CR
</PRE>
<P>

To view the entire image list at once or to browse the image list
randomly either:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Files menu button
    2. Select the "Files panel ..." item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type the $ keystroke command
</PRE>
<P>
The files panel displays the input image, input objects file, and output
results file default directories and templates, the input image and input
objects file lists, and the output results file. The current image
and input objects file are highlighted in their respective lists.
<P>

To select and display a new current image:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image list in the files panel
    2. click once on the desired image name
</PRE>
<P>
The new image will be displayed in the image display window and the files
marker and status line will update.
<P>
Note that the default input objects file and output results file also change
automatically when a new input image is selected.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.9. REDISPLAYING IMAGES</H2>
<P>

To redisplay the current image from scratch using the default display
parameters:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    2. select the "Current image" item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type the i keystroke command 
</PRE>
<P>

For most astronomical images the default image display parameters
are optimal. However in rare cases users may need to alter the default
spatial and intensity mapping parameters.
<P>

To alter the the intensity mapping parameters for the test image
xapphot$data/n5194.fits, bring up the Files panel and select image
xapphot$data/n5194.fits as described in the previous section, and:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    2. pelect the "Dispars pset" item
</PRE>
<P>
The dispars parameter editing panel will appear.
<P>
Change the dztransform parameter from "<TT>linear</TT>" to "<TT>log</TT>", the dzlimits
parameter from "<TT>median</TT>" to "<TT>image</TT>", and dz1 and dz2 from INDEF and INDEF,
to 90 and 7000.0 respectively, as follows
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move to the dztransform entry box
     2. select the "log" item
     3. move to the dzlimits entry box
     4. select the "image" item
     5. move to the dz1 entry box
     6. type backspace repeatedly to delete the existing entry
     7. type in the new value and press CR
     8. repeat steps 5-7 for dz2
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

Note that instead of typing backspace to delete characters backwards, it
is possible to position the text cursor at the beginning
of the original text, press the left mouse button, and type Control k to
delete the entire entry at once.
<P>

At this point the altered parameter values and the Apply button label should
be displayed in white. This means the new parameter values have not yet
been written to memory. To cancel the last set of changes
press the Cancel button, otherwise press the Apply button followed by
the Display button to redisplay the image with the new parameters. Window
the image display to taste using the right mouse button.
<P>

The log transform and image limits algorithm permit the user to look more
deeply into the center of the galaxy. However this transform is not
very useful for the other images in the list, so press Unlearn
to set all the dispars parameters back to their default values, press 
Display to redisplay the image, and press Dismiss to dismiss
the dispars parameter editing panel.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.10. BROWSING THE IMAGE HEADERS</H2>
<P>

To examine the header of the current image:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    2. select the "Display header" item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type the h keystroke command
</PRE>
<P>
Examine the image header by using the scroll bars.
<P>

To step sequentially forwards or backwards through the image list press
the Next or Prev buttons on the image header display panel and examine
the displayed headers.
<P>

The image header display panel can be used to correlate the contents of
the image header with the warning messages which appear in the status
line when the image is displayed.
For example xguiphot complains that the expected keyword FILTERS cannot
be found in the header of image xapphot$data/gcluster.fits. Examining
the header reveals that the image is an artificial image created with the
artdata package which did not put a FILTERS keyword into the image header.
<P>
<P>

<H2>I.11. CHECKING THE IMAGE HEADERS</H2>
<P>

The status line can only display a single line of text. 
By default xguiphot tries to read 6 keywords from the image header:
RDNOISE, GAIN, EXPTIME, AIRMASS, FILTERS, and UT. AIRMASS, FILTERS, and UT
are not actually used in the analysis but are read from the image header
and written to the
output results files. Their values default to INDEF, INDEF, and
INDEF if they are not found in the image headers. EXPTIME is used to
normalize the computed instrumental magnitude scale and defaults to 1.0.
GAIN and RDNOISE (actually only GAIN in most cases) are used to normalize
the computed mangitude errors, and default to 1.0 and 0.0 if not
found in the image header.
<P>

To check that xguiphot is reading the correct values of the required
keywords from the image headers:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type :imnumber 1
    3. move the mouse to the Images menu button
    4. select the "Impars pset" item
</PRE>
<P>
Examine the values of  the ireadnoise and igain parameters. Are these
0.0 and 1.0 or are the values different. What about the ietime parameter?
Is it 1 or some other number, and does this number agree with what is
in the image header? Similarly what about iairmass, ifilter, and iotime?
Are these values INDEF or are they real values? 
<P>

Moving to the next image by typing n in the image display window and
and watch the values of above parameters change. Do they look correct ?
<P>
<P>
