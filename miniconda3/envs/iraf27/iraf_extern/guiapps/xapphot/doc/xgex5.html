<H2>V. USING XGUIPHOT TO DO CROWDED-FIELD STELLAR APERTURE PHOTOMETRY</H2>
<P>

Xguiphot can be used to do crowded-field aperture photometry of
a single image, The following example shows one way of doing this kind
of operation.
<P>

To begin the tutorial:
<P>
<PRE>
    cl&gt; xgex5
<P>
    or
<P>
    cl&gt; unlearn xapphot
    cl&gt; epar xguiphot
        ... set images to "xapphot$data/globular.fits"
	... set objects to ""
	... set results to "default"
	... set tutorial to "xapphot$doc/xgex5.html"
</PRE>
<P>

Note that the input objects list is intentionally set to null
because we are going to generate the objects list internally.
<P>

The first step is to determine a good value for the ihwhmpsf, imindata,
imaxdata, and fthreshold parameters used by the automatic star detection
routine.  To do this we need to first estimate the width of a typical stellar
profile and the standard deviation of the background as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. move to a bright isolated star
    3. type the y keystroke to activate the model fitting panel
    4. make a note of the value after Hw: which is the half-width at
       half-max of the psf and the second value after Sky: which
       is the sky sigma value
    5. measure a few other stars by pointing at them with the
       mouse and typing the x keystroke command, and note the 
       half-width at half-max and sky sigma values 
    6. decide on good values for the hwhmpsf and the sky sigma
    7. dismiss the model fitting panel
</PRE>
<P>

A good value of ihhmpsf is ~1.5. The sky value and sigma are
around 150 and 6. We note that the brightest stars are not saturated
and that there are very few low valued pixels so we don't need to
determine values for imaxdata and imindata for this image.
We do need to make sure that the gain, readout noise, exposure time, filter,
airmass, and ut are being read correctly from the image header. To enter
the above information and make the necessary checks:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move to the List menu
     2. select the "Impars pset ..." item
     3. change ihwhmpsf to 1.5 and press CR
     4. note that the ifilter value is undefined but ignore this for
        the purpose of the tutorial 
     5. press Apply
     6. press Dismiss
     7. move to the List menu
     8. press the left mouse button
     9. select the "Findpars pset ..." item
    10. change fthrehold from 320 to 24 which is about 4 * the sky sigma
	determined above and press CR
    11. press Apply
    12. press Dismiss 
</PRE>
<P>

Now we are ready to find objects. Move to the List menu and select
the "<TT>Find list</TT>" item,  or alternatively type the @ keystroke command
in the image display window. Wait for a few moments and then examine
the status line and the image display. The detection algorithm says it
found 1562 objects in this image which looks pretty reasonable.
<P>

Now that we have the object list we are ready to do a quick check on the
algorithm parameters before beginning processing. 
<P>

First check the centering parameters as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. go to the Phot menu
    2. select the "Cenpars pset ..." item
    3. change calgorithm from "centroid1d" to "none" to avoid wandering
       centers in this crowded field
    3. change ctrmark from no to  yes since this is a crowded field,
       and we want to mark centers not apertures 
    4. press Apply
    5. press Dismiss
</PRE>
<P>

Next check the sky fitting parameters as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. go to the Phot menu
    2. select the "Skypars pset ..." item
    3. set srannulus to 10 and swannulus to 5
    4. make sure that smode is "concentric" and "sgeometry" is circular
    5. set skymark to no to avoid marking sky apertures in this
       crowded field
    6. press Apply
    7. press Dismiss
</PRE>
<P>

Finally check the photometry parameters as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. go to the Phot menu
    3. select the "Photpars pset ..." item
    3. set papertures to 3.0 which is close to the optimal value
       of ~fwhmpsf
    4. set photmark to no to avoid marking photometry apertures in
       this crowded field
    5. press Apply
    6. press Dismiss
</PRE>
<P>

Now activate the plotting panel by selecting the "<TT>Photometry plots ...</TT>"
item from the Results menu, or typing g in the image display window.
Make a trial measurement by moving to a marked star and typing the . keystroke
command, or press the left mouse button in the image display window
and selection the "<TT>Measure nearest in list</TT>" item. Do the plots look ok ? Is
the star marked correctly ? If so we are ready to measure the cluster. 
<P>
<PRE>
    1. dismiss the plotting panel because we do not want to make
       plots of all 1652 stars!
    2. go to the Files menu
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. select the "Enable logging" item
    5. move to the the Phot menu
    6. press the left mouse button
    7. select the "Measure list" item  
    8. go to the Files menu
    9. select the "Disable logging" item
</PRE>
<P>

Click on the Quit button to quit the tutorial.
<P>

The results will be in the file globular.fits.mag.1.
