USAGE
xguiphot 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images = "*"
The list of images containing the objects to be measured.
.le
.ls objects = "default"
The list of text files describing the objects to be measured. The
number of objects files must be <= the number of input images. If
the number of objects files is > 0 but < than the number of images, the last
objects file is used for the remaining images. If objects is set
to "default" or "dir$default", xguiphot searches for an input objects
file which matches the pattern "image.obj.#" or "dir$image.obj.#".
If objects is "", the objects files are undefined.
The objects file format is described in detail below.
.le
.ls results = "default"
The list of output results files. The
number of results files must be <= the number of input images. If
the number of results files is > 0 but < the number of images, the last
results file is used for the remaining images. If results is set
to "default" or "dir$default", xguiphot opens an output results
file which matches the pattern "image.mag.#" or "dir$image.mag.#".
If results = "", the output results files are undefined.
The results file format is compatible with the output file formats
used by the digiphot apphot and daophot packages.
.le
.ls robjects = ""
The list of output objects files. This parameter is currently inactive.
.le
.ls logresults = no
Log the output in interactive mode ? By default output results file
logging is turned off in interactive mode to allow time for parameter
setup and testing. Results logging is always turned on in non-interactive
mode.

DESCRIPTION

Xguiphot computes accurate center, sky values, shape statistics, fluxes,
magnitudes, and magnitude errors for selected astronomical objects in
the input images \fIimages\fR. The object coordinates
and /or geometry are either: read from the \fIskypars\fR and \fIphotpars\fR
parameter sets, specified interactively with the image cursor,
or read from the input text files \fIobjects\fR. The results
are logged in the output text files \fIresults\fR.
In non-interactive mode all measurements are logged automatically. In
interactive mode \fIlogresults\fR is normally disabled on task startup
in order to give the user time to set the parameter values and make
test measurements.

Xguiphot supports multi-aperture circular, elliptical, rectangular, and
polygonal object and sky apertures. The sky apertures may be concentric
with or offset from the object apertures.

The xguiphot algorithm parameters are grouped into parameter sets by function.
The image data and image display parameters are defined in the \fIimpars\fR
and \fIdispars\fR parameter sets respectively. The automatic object list
generating and marking algorithms are controlled by the \fIfindpars\fR
and \fIomarkpars\fR parameters respectively. The \fIcenpars\fR,
\fIskypars\fR, and \fIphotpars\fR parameters control the centering, sky fitting,
and photometry algorithms respectively. The contour and surface plotting
algorithm parameter sets control the action of the results viewing code.
If \fIupdate\fR is yes the algorithm parameter sets on disk will be
updated to the latest values.

Xguiphot can be run: interactively with the default gui (the default), 
interactively without the gui, or non-interactively. All three modes are
discussed briefly below. 

.ih
INTERACTIVE MODE WITH THE GUI

If \fIinteractive\fR is "yes" and \fIguifile\fR is "xapphot$gui/xguiphot.gui",
xguiphot activates the gui, initializes the parameters, displays the
first images, and waits for user input.  The user interacts with xguiphot
via the gui, issuing a series of mouse clicks, keystroke commands, and colon
commands  to communicate with the program.

INTERACTIVE MODE WITH XGTERM.

If \fIinteractive\fR is "yes" and \fIguifile\fR is "",
xguiphot activates the xgterm window, initializes the parameters, displays the
first images, and waits for user input.  The user interacts with xguiphot
via the xgterm graphics window, using a series of keystroke and colon
commands, to communicate with the program. 

The default gui in this case is the xgterm window. The xgterm window is used to
display the current image, enter keystroke and colon commands, and display
both printed and graphical results. Full IRAF cursor mode is supported
so users can zoom, pan, etc the displayed image just as they can any
other graph. However the usual image mouse button functions such as interactive
image display contrast and brightness windowing are not available in this
mode as they are with the default gui.

Users can edit the algorithm parameters individually using colon commands
or in groups using the epar mechanism. 

By default results logging is disabled. Users should adjust the algorithm
parameters by making trial measurements, and only turn results logging
on when an optimal set has been chosen.

See the help page for xgphot for more details and examples.

.ih
NON-INTERACTIVE MODE

Xguiphot can be run non-interactively by setting the \fIinteractive\fR
parameter to "no". In this mode xguiphot will either measure the objects
specified in the input objects files \fIobjects\fR or create and measure an
object list automatically using the current values of the \fIimpars\fR
and \fIfindpars\fR  parameters. If default object and sky aperture
geometry will be taken from the objects file; or if not defined there
from the \fIskypars\fR and \fIphotpars\fR parameter sets.
All the measurements are written to the \fIresults\fR files regardless of
the value of \fIlogresults\fR. If \fIverbose\fR is "yes" a short 
summary of each object measurement will also be printed on the standard 
output.

See the xgphot task help page for more details and examples examples.

.ih
DATA REQUIREMENTS

.ls Image Formats
Xguiphot transparently supports FITS format images (extension ".fits"), old
IRAF format images (extension ".imh"), ST format images (extension ".hhh"),
and position ordered event lists (extension ".qp"), although the event
lists must be rasterized prior to running Xguiphot.
.le

.ls Pixel Types
Xguiphot read short integer, unsigned short integer, integer,
long integer, real, and double image pixel types. However
the pixel values are read in as type real so the extra precision in
double precisions images is lost.
.le

.ls Internal Precision
Xguiphot performs most internal computations in real precision. However the
zeroth, first, and second order aperture sums are accumulated in double
precision.
.le

.ls Linearity
Xguiphot assumes that the image data are intrinsically linear and that no
non-linear operations have been performed on the data. Data which is non-linear
over a large fraction of its dynamic range must be linearized before
running Xguiphot.
.le

.ls Extreme Data Values
Extreme valued pixels must be removed from the image data
prior to running
Xguiphot. Extreme valued pixels are those with values at or
near the floating point limits of the host computer or
host machine special numbers produced by illegal floating point
operations. The latter category of values should not
be produced by IRAF software but may be produced by user programs
including IRAF imfort programs. Extreme valued pixels may cause
floating point exception  errors, since for efficiency and portability
reasons Xguiphot and most IRAF code does not check for them.
.le

.ls Bad Data Values
Saturated pixels or pixels distinguishable from good data by intensity
may be flagged by setting the impars \fIimindata\fR
and \fIimaxdata\fR parameters.  The bad data values are
still included in the photometry and shape analysis measurements, but
the measurements
are flagged, and the output magnitudes are set to INDEF. Bad data values
are automatically excluded from the sky analysis.
.le

.ls CCD Reductions
The instrumental signature must be removed from the input images prior
to running Xguiphot. CCD images should be overscan corrected, bias
corrected, dark current corrected, and flat-fielded. Careful flat-fielding
is particularly crucial.
.le

.ls Cosmic Ray Removal
Cosmic ray removal programs should be used with caution as they introduce
artificial data into the image data. A poor choice of cosmic ray
detection and removal parameters may result in the peaks of stellar objects
being clipped and poor photometry.
.le

.ls Image Statistics
Users should avoid image operations which degrade or alter the image statistics.
CCD reductions should be performed in a way which adds as little noise as
possible to the images and preserves precision of the data. Image
combining operations may be performed as long as the gain and readout
noise values are adjusted appropriately.
.le

.ls The Sky Background
Xguiphot assumes that the local sky background is approximately flat in the
vicinity of the object being measured, i.e. that it has a unique mode.
Variations in the sky background over the region being measured will
introduce errors into the photometry.
.le

.ls Sky Subtraction
The sky background may be subtracted from the image before running Xguiphot
as long as the local sky statistics, e.g. the standard deviations of the
sky pixel regions are unaffected. However users should consider carefully
before performing this operation, as other photometry packages do
require the true pixel values to be preserved for optimum performance.
.le

.ls Variable Pixel Scale
Xguiphot "assumes" that the pixel scale is uniform over the image. If it
isn't which may be the case if the images exibit significant optical
distortion, users will have to take this into account when they interpret
their photometry. Traditional flat-fielding methods applied to such
images will introduce a variable photometric zero point and errors
in the resulting photometry. Users may choose to resample the images
to a uniform grid or apply a known correction to the computed
magnitudes. Which approach is best will depend of their goals and
the reduction history of the image.
.le

.ls Small Apertures
Xguiphot users should restrict themselves to
apertures radii &gt;= 2 pixels to avoid scatter in the effective apertures
due to pixelation affects. Future versions will offer more accurate
integration or subsampling options.
.le

.ls The Image PSF
The Xguiphot photometry algorithms make no assumptions about about the
shape or size of the PSF. However other algorithms such as the automatic
stellar object detection algorithm and some centering algorithms will
function better if a reasonable value is supplied for the half-width of
the PSF. The approximate width of the PSF can be entered by setting the
impars parameter \fIihwhmpsf\fR. Stellar photometry
through small apertures, i.e. those less that the size of the stars assumes
that the PSF is uniform over the field.
.le

.ls Required Header Keywords
Before running Xguiphot users should gather all the data required to
determine the following quantities: the effective readout noise
of the data in electrons, the effective gain of the data in electrons
per ADU, the effective exposure in any time units as long as the
units are consistent for any set of images being analyzed together,
the filter id, the effective airmass of the observation at mid-exposure,
and the time of the observation.
Xguiphot requires this information to compute valid error estimates,
to normalize the computed magnitudes, and to pass on any information that
may be required in subsequent analysis. By editing the appropriate
impars parameters users can instruct Xguiphot
to either read this information
from the image headers or use values supplied by the user.
.le

.ih
THE INPUT OBJECTS FILE FORMAT

The input objects file consists of a list of object descriptions. Each object
description consists of an object region description and an optional
sky region description. If the sky description is present it must
be separated from the object description by the string " ; " as shown
below.

.nf

Syntax

object region definition [; [sky region definition]]

Example

256.23 258.31 circle 25.0
256.23 258.31 circle 25.0 ;
256.23 258.31 circle 25.0 ; circle 30.0 40.0
.fi

Object regions may be points, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, or
undefined.  Each geometry has its own syntax as shown below.

The x and y coordinates are required in all cases. The radii field may
define a single radius, e.g. "10.0", a list of radii, e.g. "3,6,9,12,15,18",
or a range of radii, e.g. "1:20.0:2.0". If the polygon radii field is
present it is treated as a width, and the polygonal object aperture is extended
outward by the size of the radii. Objects with missing or INDEF valued required
radii fields will automatically have their geometries set to INDEF. All
radii measurements are assumed to be in units of the
\fIimpars.iscale\fR parameter. Missing axis ratio
and position angle fields default to the values of 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.
If the vertices field of a polygonal object is ommitted, the vertices of
the last defined object polygon are used. If no object polygon has been
defined by the time the first polygonal object appears in the list,
the object geometry is set to INDEF.

Sky regions may be points, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, objects,
or undefined.  The object option means "use the same geometry as the object
region". Each geometry has its own syntax as shown below.

Sky regions may be concentric with the object region, i.e. no x and y
sky region coordinates are defined, or offset, i.e. the x and y coordinates
are defined. If the sky geometry is "object", then the sky region inherits
the geometry, axis ratio, and position angle of the object region. The inner
and out sky annulus radii must be defined for all geometries except polygonal.
Missing or undefined axis ratio and position fields default to values
of 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.

ALGORITHMS

A brief description of the object finding algorithms, the
centering algorithms, the
sky fitting algorithms and the photometry algorithms can be found in the
online help pages for the \fIfindpars\fR, \fIcenterpars\fR, \fRfitskypars\fR,
and \fIphotpars\fR tasks.

The image data dependent parameters, the image display parameters, and
the object list marking parameters are described in the help for the
\fIimpars\fR, \fIdispars\fR, and \fIomarkpars\fR parameter sets.
The object and sky region contour and surface plotting parameters are
described in the help for the \fIcplotpars\fR and \fIsplotpars\fR tasks.

THE RESULTS FILE FORMAT

If \fIinteractive\fR = "no" and \fIverbose\fR = "yes", or \fIinteractive\fR =
"yes" and \fIguifile\fR = "", then the following quantities are printed on
the standard output as each object is measured.

.nf
image  xcenter  ycenter msky  hw[N] ax[N] pa[N]  flux[N] mag[N] merr[N]
       pier[N] logresults
.fi

where N is the index of the largest aperture. Image, xcenter, ycenter, and
sky are the image name, x and y coordinates of the object center, and the
modal sky value respectively. Hw, ax, and pa are the half-width at half-max,
axial ratio, and position angle of the object derived from a second order
moment analysis through the largest aperture. Flux, mag, and magerr are the
flux, magnitude, and magnitude error computed through the largest aperture.
Pier is the photometry error code described below.  Logresults is log+ or log-
depending on whether or not results logging is turned on or off.  If
interactive = "yes" and the guifile is defined, then the above quantities
minus the image name are written to the status line in the image display window.

In interactive mode full output is written to the output text
file \fIresults\fR if \fIlogresults\fR is "yes". In batch mode full output
is always written to the results file if one is defined. At the beginning of
each results file is a header listing the values of all the algorithm parameters
at the time the first object record is written. From that point on a new
parameter record is written to the results file every time the parameter
value is altered.

For each object measured the following quantities are written to the 
results file.

.nf
       xinit       yinit    id     objects  lid
       xcenter     ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr          cier cerror

       rapert    sum        area        flux      mag     merr  pier perror
       hwidth    sharpness  axratio      ell      theta
.fi
Objects is the name of the input objects file.
Id and lid are the object sequence numbers in the output results and input
objects files respectively. Cier and cerror are the centering algorithm
error code and associated
error message respectively.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter, xshift, yshift,
xerr, and yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units. The sense of
the xshift and yshift definitions is as follows.

.nf
        xshift = xcenter - xinit
        yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

Sier and serror are the sky fitting error code and associated error
message respectively. Xsky and ysky define the center of the sky region.
Xsky and ysky should be the same as xcenter and ycenter if the sky fitting
mode is "concentric", otherwise they may be different.
Msky and stdev are the estimate of the sky value per pixel and
the standard deviation of the sample of sky pixels used to compute
flux, mag, and merr.
Nsky and nsrej are the number of
sky pixels used to compute the sky value  and the number of sky pixels
rejected from the sky fit respectively.

Rapert, sum, area, and flux  are the radius of the photometry aperture
in scale units, the total number of counts including sky in the aperture,
the area of the aperture in square pixels, and the total number of counts
excluding sky in the aperture. Mag and merr are the magnitude and
error in the magnitude in the aperture as computed below.

.nf
        flux[N] = sum[N] - area[N] * msky
         mag[N] = zmag - 2.5 * log10 (flux[N]) + 2.5 * log10 (itime)
        merr[N] = 1.0857 * error[N] / flux[N]
       error[N] = sqrt (flux[N] / epadu + area[N] * stdev**2 +
                  area[N]**2 * stdev**2 / nsky)
.fi

Pier and perror are photometry error code and accompanying error message.

Hwidth, sharpness, axratio, ell, and theta are the estimates of the half-width
at half-maximum, the sharpness statistic, the axis ratio, the ellipticity, and
the position angle of the object, derived from a second order moment
analysis as shown below.

.nf
       dx = x - xcenter
       dy = y - ycenter
       di = i - msky

       Mxx[N] = sum (di * dx * dx) / flux[N]
       Mxy[N] = sum (di * dx * dy) / flux[N]
       Myy[N] = sum (di * dy * dy) / flux[N]

    hwidth[N] = sqrt (log (2) * (Mxx[N] + Myy[N]))
 sharpness[N] = hwidth[N] / fwhmpsf
       ell[N] = sqrt ((Mxx[N] - Myy[N]) ** 2 + 4 * Mxy[N] ** 2) /
               (Mxx[N] + Myy[N])
   axratio[N] = 1.0 - ell[N]
     theta[N] = 0.5 * atan (2 * Mxy[N] / (Mxx[N] - Myy[N]))
.fi


The exposure time, airmass, filter id, and time of observation
are stored in the header keywords, ietime, iairmass, ifilter, 
and iotime and updated to the appropriate values when the image being
analyzed is changed.

THE RESULTS FILE ERROR CODES

If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values of cier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
        0        # No error
        301      # The input image is undefined
        302      # The centering aperture is off the image
        303      # The centering aperture is partially off the image
        304      # The centering aperture is too small
        305      # There is bad data in the centering aperture
        306      # The S/N ratio in the centering aperture is too low
        307      # The x or y center fit is singular
        308      # The x or y center fit did not converge
        309      # The x or y center shift is greater than maxshift
.fi

If all goes well during the sky fitting process then the error code sier
will be 0. Non-zero values of sier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
        0         # No error
        401       # The input image is undefined
        402       # The sky aperture is undefined
        403       # The sky aperture is partially off the image (not used)
        404       # The sky pixel histogram is undefined
        405       # The sky pixel histogram is flat or concave
        406       # There are too few points for a good sky fit
        407       # The sky fit is singular
        408       # The sky fit did not converge
        409       # The graphics stream is undefined (not used)
        410       # The file of sky values is undefined (not used)
        411       # The sky file is at EOF (not used)
        412       # Cannot read the sky file values correctly (not used)
        413       # The best fit parameters are non-physical
.fi

If no error occursor during the measurement of the magnitudes then pier is
0. Non-zero values of pier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
        0         # No error
        501       # The photometry aperture is off the image
        502       # The photometry aperture is partially off the image
        503       # The sky value is undefined
        504       # The object is too faint
        505       # There is bad data in the photometry aperture
