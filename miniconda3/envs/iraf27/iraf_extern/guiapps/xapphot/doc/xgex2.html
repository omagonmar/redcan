<H2>TUTORIAL II. USING XGUIPHOT TO CREATE, VIEW, EDIT, AND SAVE OBJECT LISTS</H2>
<P>

Xguiphot provides facilities for creating, displaying, editing, and saving
objects lists. Objects lists can be read from the objects files, created
interactively using the image display and mouse, or created automatically
using the builtin object finding algorithm. The following tutorial demonstrates
these cabilities using test images and object files in the directory
xapphot$data/.
<P>
To begin the tutorial type the following:
<P>
<PRE>
    cl&gt; xgex2
</PRE>
<P>
After the gui is activated the first image in the input list, gcluster.fits,
is displayed in the image display window, and the gui is ready for user input.
<P>
<P>

<H2>II.1. CREATING OBJECTS LISTS FROM OBJECTS FILES</H2>
<P>

To read the current objects file into an object list:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    2. select the "Current file" item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type the r keystroke command
</PRE>
<P>
Examine the status line. You should see a message of the form
"<TT>Read 700 objects file from objects file xapphot$data/gcluster.coo.1</TT>".
This means that the objects list has been created and  is ready to
be used.
<P>
<P>

<H2>II.2. MARKING THE OBJECTS LISTS ON THE IMAGE DISPLAY</H2>
<P>

To overlay the current objects list on the displayed image:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    2. select the "Mark list" item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. type the m keystroke command
</PRE>
<P>

Note that it is not necessary to read the current objects file before
marking the objects. Any command that expects to operate on the objects
list, will automatically try to read it in from the current objects file, if
it does not already exist.
<P>

Note that all the objects in the objects list are marked with
a green +. The shape, color, and size of the default mark can be altered
by editing the omarkpars parameter set. For example to change the default mark
to a point as may be desirable in very crowded fields:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
     2. select the "Omarkpars pset ..." item
     3. move the mouse to the ocharmark parameter entry box
     4. select the "point" item
     5. click on the Apply Button
     6. click on the Erase Button
     7. click on the Show Button
</PRE>
<P>

To overlay size and shape information on the displayed image repeat
commands 3-7 above but instead of selecting  item "<TT>point</TT>" in step 4,
select item "<TT>shape</TT>" instead. Dismiss the omarkchars parameter editing box.
<P>

Examine the displayed image. Note that that the extended objects are
clearly marked by ellipses. Smaller objects are marked with ellipses or
crosses depending on whether or not they are galaxies, i.e. have shape
information, or are stars, i.e. are point sources.
<P>
<P>

<H2>II.3. EXAMINING THE OBJECT LIST</H2>
<P>

To examine the actual objects list created in the previous section:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    2. select the "List panel ..." item
</PRE>
<P>

Move through the object list using the scrollbars. Note that objects
1-600 are ellipses defined by 6 fields: x coordinate, y coordinate,
geometry (always ellipse in this case), semi-major axis, axial ratio,
and position angle.  Objects 601-700 are point sources defined by x
and y coordinates only.
<P>

Now step through the image list, mark each image with its coordinate list,
and examine the list in the list panel as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type the n  keystroke command to display the next image
    3. type the m keystroke command to mark objects
    4. scroll through the object list displayed in the List panel
    5. repeat steps 1-4 for all the input images
</PRE>
<P>

Note that there are 2000 objects in xapphot$data/globular.fits and all of
them are stars. The images xapphot$data/gcluster.fits and
xapphot$data/globular.fits are artifical images created with the artdata
package. The accompanying input objects files were created with
the artdata package starlist and gallist tasks and edited for input
to xguiphot.
<P>

The next 4 images are of standard star fields in m92. They were taken
at Kitt Peak. The associated objects files were created using a finding chart
for m92, the IRAF image display program ximtool, and the IRAF tasks
display and rimcursor.
<P>

The 7th image is of the Sombrero galaxy. The input objects file was typed
in by hand. Note that the sky region, by default marked in blue, is a
rectangle which is offset from the object region. In general the sky
region is only marked if the geometry is defined or if the sky region
is offset from the object region.
<P>

The 8th image is of M51. Numerous point source and extended objects are
marked on it. Note that there are two offset sky regions and it is not
necessarily obvious which sky region goes with which object. There are
three ways to find out:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse inside the green rectangle
    2. note the x and y coordinates
    3. move the mouse to the objects list in the List panel
    4. scroll the objects list searching for the nearest object
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
     2. select the "Omarkpars pset ..." item
     3. move the mouse to the onumber parameter entry box
     4. click on the left mouse button
     5. click on the Apply Button
     6. click on the Erase Button
     7. click on the Show Button
</PRE>
<P>

Note that that the green rectangle marked O10 goes with the 
blue circle marked S10 and that the green ellipse marked O7 goes with the
blue rectangle marked S7, and that the numbers 7 and 10 correspond to
the sequence numbers in the object list.
<P>

Turn numbering off by typing the command :onumber no in the image display
window. Note that the value of the onumber parameter in the omarkpars
parameter editing panel is automatically set to no at the same time.
<P>

To try the third method of locating an object in the object list:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. move the mouse close to the object (not sky) region
       of interest
    3. type the ~ keystroke command
<P>
    or
<P>
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. select the "Find nearest in list" item
</PRE>
<P>

You will either see a warning message in the status line saying
something like "<TT>Warning: Marked object not in object list</TT>" or the
object nearest the cursor position will be high-lighted in the object
list. Try pointing the cursor at the large green ellipse near the
center of the image and typing ~.
<P>
<P>

<H2>II.4. CREATING OBJECTS LISTS AUTOMATICALLY</H2>
<P>

Objects list can be created automatically using a builtin object
detection algorithm. Before exercising this option set the input
objects file list to "<TT></TT>" as shown below:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the Files menu button
    2. select the "Files panel ..." option
    3. move to the Input Objects Files Objects entry box
    4. move the cursor to the beginning of the current entry
    5. click the left mouse button to position the cursor
    6. type Control k to delete the entry and press CR
    7. move to the first image in the input image list
    8. click the left mouse button
</PRE>
<P>

Note that the default input objects file list is now empty and the current
input objects file is now undefined.
<P>

To create an objects list using the builtin object detection algorithm
and default findpars parameters:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    2. select the "Find list ..." item
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type the @ keystroke command
</PRE>
<P>

Examine the status line. When the command has completed a message
should appear stating how many objects were detected. Examine the
image display window. The detected objects should be
marked on the image display. Examine the objects list in the
list panel. The detected objects should be listed in the list panel.
<P>

Users should realize that the current object detection algorithm is
optimized for stellar objects. The algorithm is controlled by the impars
parameters ihwhmpsf, idatamin, and idatamax and the findpars parameter set.
<P>

To determine and set a good value value for the ihwhmpsf parameter:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. move the mouse to a likely looking stellar object
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. select the "Compute model fit" item
    5. note the value of Hw printed in the status line
    6. repeat steps 2-5 for several objects
    7. type :ihwhmpsf &lt;bestvalue&gt; in the image display window
</PRE>
<P>

Note that steps 3-4 can be replaced by typing the x keystroke command.
<P>

To activate the model fitting panel:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the image display window
    2. move the mouse to a likely looking stellar object
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. select the "Show model plot" item
    5. note the value of Hw printed in the model fitting panel status line
    6. move to a new object
    7. press the left mouse button
    8. select the "Compute model fit" item
    9. note the value of Hw printed in the model fitting panel status line
   10. repeat steps 6-9 for several objects
   10. type :ihwhmpsf &lt;bestvalue&gt; in the image display window
</PRE>
<P>

Note that steps 7-8 can be replaced by typing the x keystroke command.
<P>

It is also possible to set the ihhmpsf from the model fitting panel.
Once a good value has been computed:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the model fitting panel
    2. press the Activate button
    3. press the Setwidth button
    4. press the Deactivate button
</PRE>
<P>

The new ihwhmpsf can also be entered by activating the impars parameter set
editing panel and typing in the new value.
<P>

Now rerun the object detection algorithm using the new value of ihwhmpsf
(in my case it was 1.25 instead of 1.0) by typing @ in the image display
window. Note that there is not much difference, 38 objects were
found this time instead of 36 in my case.
<P>

To adjust the remaining detection algorithm parameters:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    2. delect the "Findpars pset ..." item
</PRE>
<P>

Note that the default detection threshold is 320. This means that only objects
with peak counts &gt; 320 counts above background will be detected and
explains why the majority of the objects were not detected. What
is a reasonable value for fthreshold? This depends on what you are
trying to do. If the object of the exercise is to
detect everything down to something like 4 * sigma where sigma
is the standard deviation of the background, then one should set
the detection threshold appropriately.
<P>

A good value for sigma can be found by moving to an isolated star and
typing the x keystroke command to compute the model fit. The last quantity
in the status line printout is the standard deviation of the background
in counts. Repeating this operation for a few objects in the image
xapphot$data/gcluster.fits
suggests that sigma is ~ 20 counts, so the detection threshold should
be ~80 counts. To set a new value for the detection threshold:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the fthreshold entry box in the findpars panel
    2. type backspace repeatedly to delete the existing entry
    3. type in 80.0 and press CR
    4. press the Apply button
    5. press the Find button
</PRE>
<P>

Examine the displayed image and the new object list in the List panel.
Do the detections look good? If so save the new list as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the Save List area on the List panel 
    2. press the Save button
</PRE>
<P>

Examine the status line.  A message should appear stating how many objects
were written to the objects file. Note that the default output object file
names have the form image.obj.#.
<P>

Now work through the remaining images in the list using the default
parameters and saving the object lists in objects files as shown below.
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type n to display the next image
    3. type @ to create the objects list
    4. press the Save button to save the detected lists to disk
</PRE>
<P>

Note that the default detection parameters did a reasonable job for the
first 6 images, but produced a lot of "<TT>spurious</TT>" detections
in difficult
regions, e.g. the dust lane of ngc4594 in ngc4594.fits and the center
of ngc5194 in ngc5194.fits.
<P>

Now change the input objects list from the null list "<TT></TT>" to default in
order to pick up the new lists using either the Files panel as
described earlier or one of the following colon commands.
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type :objects default
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. :objects *.obj.*
</PRE>
<P>

Note that the latter command will pick up all files contain "<TT>.obj.</TT>" in
their names regardless of the names and number of the input images, whereas the
former command will only pick up the highest version number file for
each image.
<P>

Now step through the image with the n and m keystroke commands and the
list panel to check the new lists.
<P>
<P>

<H2>II.5. CREATING OBJECT LISTS INTERACTIVELY WITH THE IMAGE CURSOR</H2>
<P>

Object lists can also be created interactively using the image display and
image cursor. This technique can be quite useful for making simple
x and y coordinate lists, for making lists containing a few extended
objects, or for making lists of mixed extended and point sources.
<P>

Before beginning this example set the input objects list to "<TT></TT>" as shown
below.
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the image display window
    2. type :objects ""
</PRE>
<P>

The first few examples will show how to create simple coordinate lists
using the image display and image cursor.
<P>
To create a simple object list of x and y coordinates:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the Files menu button
    2. select the "Files panel ..." item
    3. move to the image xapphot$data/m92v1.fits
    4. click the left mouse button
    5. move the mouse to the Lists menu button
    6. select the "Draw list ..." item
</PRE>
<P>
or simply type the command :imname xapphot$data/m92v1.fits in the
image display window followed by the z and a keystroke commands.
<P>

After the prompt appears in the status line:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. enter o followed by CR to select the object only option
    2. move to the object(s) of interest and type .
    3. type q to quit
    4. type e to erase the current marks and m to mark the new list
    5. examine the new list in the List panel
</PRE>
<P>

To add new objects to the list either type the a keystroke command in the
image display window, or select the "<TT>Add objects(s) ...</TT>" item from the Edit
menu, or hit the Draw button in the View and Edit section of the List panel
and repeat steps 1-5.
<P>

Objects can be deleted or undeleted from the objects list, by selecting
the "<TT>Delete object(s) ...</TT>" or "<TT>Undelete object(s) ...</TT>" items from the
Edit menu, or by moving to the appropriate objects in the image display window
and typing the d or u keystroke commands, or by clicking on the object
in the List panel and hitting the Delete or Undelete key. The entire
objects list can be deleted by selecting the "<TT>Delete list</TT>" item from
the Edit menu, or by typing z in the image display window, or by hitting the
Init button in the List panel. Try out some of the above functions.
It is not hard to recreate the list if you make a mistake.
<P>

To create an object list consisting of same sized circular apertures
with same sized concentric circular sky annuli:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move to the image display window
     2. type i to redisplay the current image
     3. type z followed by a to initialize the list
     4. at the prompt type a to select object plus annular sky option
     5. move to star and type c
     6. move to desired radius of circle and type c
     7. type c again to add circular sky annulus
     8. move to desired inner radius of sky annulus and type c
     9. move to outer radius of sky annulus and type c
    10. move to new object and type a followed by a
    11. Repeat step 10 for each new object
    12. Type q to quit
</PRE>
<P>

Move to the image xapphot$data/ngc4594.fits and use it to create an
object list consisting of a single elliptical object aperture
and an offset rectangular sky region as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move to the image display window
     2. type z followed by a to initialize the objects list
     3. type b to select the object and offset sky option
     4. move to center of large galaxy and type e
     5. move to position of semi-major axis and type e
     6. move to position of semi-minor axis and type e
     7. move to center of offset sky region and type r
     8. move to semi-major axis of rectangle and type r
     9. move to semi-minor axis or rectangle and type r
    10. type q to quit
</PRE>
<P>

Examine the marked apertures and the object list in the List panel.
<P>

To create an object list consisting of a single object for which you
know the geometry already:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. activate the List panel from the Lists menu
     2. move the mouse to the List panel
     3. press the Init button to initalize the list
     4. go to the Enter object geometry box
     5. type in "285 194 ellipse 140 0.65 0.0 ; 520 282 rectangle 0 50 0.5 90"
     6. hit the Enter button
     7. hit the Erase button
     8. hit the Show button
</PRE>
<P>

Examine the marked object in the image display and the object list in the 
List panel.  If all you see are two + signs marking the center of the
object and sky region, press the Omarkpars button to activate the omarkpars
parameter editing panel, set the ocharmark parameter to "<TT>shape</TT>", and repeat
steps 7-8 above.
Note that on some systems it is possible  to cut and paste from a text file
displayed in another window into the object geometry entry box.
<P>

<H2>II.6. CREATING OBJECTS LISTS INTERACTIVELY WITH MARKERS</H2>
<P>

Object list can also be created interactively using the photometry 
marker. This method is most suitable for defining object and sky
apertures for large objects.
<P>

Move to the image xapphot$data/ngc4594.fits and use markers to create an
object list consisting of a single elliptical object aperture
and an offset rectangular sky region as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
     1. move to the image display window
     2. type z to initialize the objects list
     3. press the left mouse button
     4. select the "Set offset sky" item
     5. move the mouse to the center of the elliptical galaxy
     6. press the left mouse button
     7. select the "Show phot marker" item
     8. move the mouse to the desired sky position
     9. press the left mouse button
    10. select the "Offset sky marker" item
</PRE>
<P>

At this point the object and sky region markers should be visible and
positioned more or less at the desired object and sky positions. The object
and sky marker geometry however corresponds to the default object and
sky geometries defined in the photpars and skypars parameter sets.
The geometry, position, size and shape of the markers must now
be adjusted interactively as follows. 
<P>
<P>
To resize the object marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse to the boundary of the object marker
    2. wait until the cursor changes to a dot inside a square
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. drag out the marker boundary until it is the desired size
    5. release the left mouse button
</PRE>
<P>
To reposition the enlarged object marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse inside the marker
    2. wait until the cursor changes to a small cross
    3. press the left mouse button
    4. drag the marker to the correct position
    5. release the left mouse button
</PRE>
<P>

To change the object marker geometry from circular to elliptical:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse inside the object marker

<P>

To change the shape of the object marker which probably still looks like
a circle:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. follow the instructions for resizing the object marker
</PRE>
<P>
but try not to let the marker get too small since it becomes hard to
manipulate in that case.
<P>
To rotate the object marker ellipse:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. hold down the Shift key
    2. place the mouse on the border of the ellipse
    3. wait until the cursor changes to a . in a box
    4. press the left mouse button
    5. drag the ellipse around to the desired position angle
    6. release the left mouse button and the Shift key
</PRE>
<P>
<P>

To adjust the sky markers:
<P>
To resize of the sky marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. decrease the size of the inner sky marker as described 
       for the object marker but make sure that the inner sky
       marker does not completely disappear 
    2. increase the size of the outer sky marker as described
       for the object marker
</PRE>
<P>

To position the sky marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. position the outer sky marker as described for the object
       marker
    2. the inner sky marker will automatically reposition with
       it
</PRE>
<P>

To change the sky geometry to rectangle:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move to the object marker
    2. follow the instructions for the object marker but ...
    3. select the Sky geometry menu instead of the Object
       geometry menu and ...
    4. the Rectangle geometry instead of the Ellipse geometry
</PRE>
<P>

To resize the rectangular sky marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. follow the instructions for resizing the object marker but ...
    2. wait until the cursor changes to a box with arrows instead of
       a box with a . inside and ...
    3. drag on the corners of the box
</PRE>
<P>

To rotate the rectangular sky marker:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. follow the instructions for rotating the object marker but ...
    2. wait until the cursor changes to a box with arrows instead
       of a box with a . inside
</PRE>
<P>

To save the marker geometry to the object list:
<P>
<PRE>
    1. move the mouse inside the object marker
    2. press the right mouse button
    3. select the "Save to objects list" item
    4. check the list panel to see if the object appeared correctly
