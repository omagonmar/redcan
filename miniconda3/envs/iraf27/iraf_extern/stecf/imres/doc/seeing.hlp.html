<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
This task is for creating simulated groung-based telescope point-spread
function (PSF) images. It is based on a model proposed by Saglia et al.
1993, MNRAS, 264, 961 which uses a simple atmospheric turbulence description.
The radial profile is derived from the Fourier transform of an exponential
power-spectrum model. Apart from the FWHM (which is just a scaling and
which can be different in X and Y) there is one free parameter called gamma.
The default value of 5/3 comes from the theory but the authors find that
slightly different values may give better simulated PSFs, depending on the
telescope, site and conditions. 
<p>
It is strongly suggested that this task only be used after careful reading
of the Saglia paper. It has had little use and there may be problems.
<p>
It is important that the images used are large enough to avoid artifacts
which come from truncating the image before the Fourier transform is
taken. This may be checked by looking at the values displayed by the
program for the extreme values in the images. In rough terms the minimum 
in the &quot;input image&quot; should be small (eg, 10-8) and so should the minimum in
the output real part, relative to the peak (eg, a factor of 10-6 lower). The
output imaginary part should be very small (eg, 10-10).

<h1>TIMINGS</h1>
<blockquote>
The time spent is mostly taken up by the Fourier Transform. Array sizes
which are powers of two are most efficient.
