STECF/IMPOL Imaging Polarimetry Package

Brief installation notes.
Richard Hook, ST-ECF, 17th June 1999

[Draft]

This package was written by Jeremy Walsh for analysis of imaging polarimetry
data from HST. It is a standard Iraf package with the source in src$, help
files in doc$ and library files in lib$ (including a help library). There
is a mkpkg which works in the normal way.

Note that this package is part of the STECF Iraf package and is not
normally installed independently.

Installation:

i) Unpack the tar file into an empty directory outside the Iraf directory
   tree, typically ...iraf/extern/stecf/impol.

ii) Define the package for Iraf, either in a personal startup file
    (loginuser.cl) or in $iraf/unix/hlib/extern.pkg

         set impol=<appropriate directory>     
         task impol.pkg = impol$impol.cl

iii) Add the line

         impol$lib/helpdb.mip

     to the standard Iraf "helpdb" environment variable. For a system
     installation this will be at the end of $iraf/unix/hlib/extern.pkg

iv) Enter Iraf (cl) and define the environment:

     cl> softools
     so> impol
     im> cd impol

v) Configure the appropriate architecture

     im> mkpkg <arch>

   <arch> takes one of the standard Iraf values: sparc,ssun (Solaris),
   linux, redhat,hp700,irix,alpha,freebsd,rs6000 etc. This package has
   been tested on Solaris 2.5.1, Redhat Linux 6 and HP-UX 10.20 in
   call cases under Iraf 2.11.1

vi) Build the package:

     im> mkpkg -p stsdas -p tables

This should only produce benigh compilation warnings and create a package
x_impol.e file.

[Note that this OUGHT to move the final executable from the src$ directory
 to the appropriate bin but seems not to. I think this is a failure in
 my understanding of mkpkg files... You may have to do:

 so> rename impol$src/impolbinx_impol.e impol$bin/x_impol.e    ]

Once this is done it should be possible to enter Iraf again, define the
IMPOL package by typing "impol" and also gain access to help information.

Please remember that this is just a test version and there may well be 
problems.
