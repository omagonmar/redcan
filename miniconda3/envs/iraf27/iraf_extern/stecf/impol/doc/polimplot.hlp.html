<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
This task is a flexible tool for plotting a polarization
vector map from two images of the polarization and the position angle
of the polarization vector. Whilst it can be used to plot general
vector maps, it is primarily aimed at polarization maps, such as the
output images from the task hstpolima. 
<p>
If polarization and position angle error images are available there is
an option to plot them as vectors centred on the plotted points
but with larger and smaller lengths given by the plus and minus 
polarization error bars and rotations given by the maximum and mimumum 
offset angles specified by the plus and minus position angle errors.
The 'error' vectors are plotted as dotted lines. Note however that
the polarization and position angle errors may not strictly be 1 sigma 
errors, so this should be seen as an illustrative tool.
<p>
If the data has been binned in producing the polarization and position
angle maps, and it is required to plot the vector map on the unbinned 
scale, then the binning factor must be supplied 
in order to match the polarization map with an unbinned image or plot.
If the binning factor is not given then the labelled plot will display 
binned pixels only.
<p>
In order to convert the polarization in percent to a length, a scalar
multipler is used to convert vector length to pixel length before 
plotting. A little trial and error, together with altering the 
parameter to control the parameter which sets the number of points to 
skip over in plotting (parameter xysam), will soon produce a map where 
the vectors do not overlay each other. 
<p>
The range of polarization values to plot can be selected - this helps
to avoid having points (dots) where the polarization is zero or very close to 
zero, or where there may be large polarization values (usually
associated with large errors). An additive correction can be applied 
to the position angle values to ensure that the absolute position angle is
plotted. Such rotations can be introduced by instrument rotation 
or realignment of images.
<p>
In order to overplot the polarization vector map on an image device
(imd) it is necessary to specify the normalised device coordinates
(NDC) of the left and right ends of the X axis and the bottom and
top ends of the Y axis. Once an image has been displayed, the
NDC of the four limits can be determined using
stsdas.graphics.sdisplay imdisp_pos. The four values can then be 
entered in order to the parameters left, right, bottom, top. 
See the help for fieldplot and imdisp_pos for more details.

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1. To plot an unbinned 512x512 pixel polarization map and 
vectors for the errors over the polarization range 2 to 100%, 
correcting the position angle by +12.5 degrees and plotting 
every fourth point, with axes and labelling on the standard 
graphics display in square format:
<p>
cl&gt; polimplot inpol=&quot;nebpol.fits&quot; inpopa=&quot;nebpa.fits&quot; poi_err=yes
    inpoer=&quot;nebpoer.fits&quot; inpaer=&quot;nebpaer.fits&quot; xybin=1 
    poscal=0.25 polow=2.0 pohigh=100.0 pacorr=12.5 xysam=3
    polab=yes title=&quot;Reflection Nebula&quot; xlabel=&quot;Alpha&quot;
    ylabel=&quot;Delta&quot; device=&quot;stdgraph&quot; left=0.19 right=0.82
    bottom=0.12 top=0.96 erase=yes
<p>
2. To display an intensity image on the image display device,
determine the NDC of the corners of the displayed image and
overplot a polarization map which has been produced by binning the
raw data by 2x2, plotting the polarization range 1 to 50% and
plotting every second point, without error vectors or labelling:
<p>
cl&gt; display ima=&quot;nebint.fits&quot;
cl&gt; imdisp_pos image=&quot;nebint.fits&quot;
cl&gt; lpar imdisp_pos
cl&gt; polimplot inpol=&quot;nebpol.fits&quot; inpopa=&quot;nebpa.fits&quot; poi_err=no
    inpoer=&quot;&quot; inpaer=&quot;&quot; xybin=2 poscal=0.10 polow=1.0 pohigh=50.0 
    pacorr=0.0 xysam=1 polab=no title=&quot;&quot; xlabel=&quot;&quot; ylabel=&quot;&quot; 
    device=&quot;imdr&quot; left=0.3402 right=0.6598 bottom=0.3402 
    top=0.6598 erase=yes
