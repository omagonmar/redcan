<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
This task is a tool for performing aperture polarimetry for data 
from those HST instruments with imaging polarizer facilities 
(currently FOC, WFPC2 and NICMOS and in future ACS). A non-HST 
instrument can also be handled -  called 'SPECIAL'. The error 
frames are required to produce output error files and should 
contain all sources of error (photon noise, systematics (e.g. 
flat fielding errors) and read-out noise). 
<p>
All instrument specific parameters are picked up from the header and
the telescope rotation angle is read from the PA_V3 or ORIENTAT
descriptor (see below for details and also examples).
The polarizer and or colour filter name in the header is matched with
values found in the instpoltab table file and these are used to
set the instrument specific polarization parameters required to
compute the Stokes parameter and linear polarization data.
The correction for polarizer transmission and pick-off mirror
induced polarization follows closely the treatment for WFPC2
by Biretta and McMaster (WFPC2 ISR 97-11). The instrumental
polarization is included for effects that are not
collected by these physically based parameters. If the values 
of the polarizer efficiences for calculating each Stokes parameter 
are equal for all input images (such as by specifying the same 
polarizer orientation and instrument position angle), then no 
calculation of polarization is possible. The task exits 
with an error in this case.
<p>
All errors are computed by Gaussian error propagation. To correct
for the bias in linear polarization values which occurs when
the Stokes parameter errors are large and the determination
of linear polarization is no longer Gaussian error dominated, 
the method advocated by Wardle &amp; Kronberg (ApJ, 194, 249, 
1974) is employed, using the solution of the Rice 
distribution (see also Simmons &amp; Stewart, A&amp;A, 142, 10, 1985 
for a discussion). Tests with synthetic data show that this 
correction does an adequate job to pol/sigma(pol) of about 2. Below 
that value it is best to use Monte Carlo methods which are not 
directly dealt with here. The method of computing the errors on 
the polarization position angle depends on the polarization
signal-to-noise (i.e. pol/sigma(pol)). If pol/sigma(pol) is
greater than 8 then the simple method (sigma(theta) =
28.65*sigma(pol)/pol) is employed (Serkowski, Adv. in Astron. &amp; 
Astrophys. 1, 289, 1962); if pol/sigma(pol) is
less than 8 then the distribution function of the position angle
errors is integrated to derive the 1 sigma error (see
Naghizadeh-Khouei &amp; Clarke, A&amp;A, 274, 968, 1993). Of course if
the input error frames are all zero, no correction for bias is 
performed and all output errors are set to zero.
<p>
The parameters of the apertures for performing polarimetry 
are read from an input STSDAS table. Circular apertures are specified by
an X and Y centre (currently only pixel coordinates are supported),
the radius of the circle over which to sum counts for the object,
the distance between the outer radius of the object circle and
the inner radius of the sky annulus and the width of the sky annulus.
A name for identification purposes can be given for each aperture.
<p>
The mean value of the sky/background per pixel is calculated and
subtracted from the object signal. The mean sky can be determined
by sigma clip iterations where values differing by greater
than SIGSKY*rms on the mean are excluded at each iteration.
<p>
The following header keywords are required in order that the 
instrumental polarization parameters can be matched against the
instrument table files:
<pre>
for FOC - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, ORIENTAT
for NICMOS - INSTRUME, FILTER, ORIENTAT
for WFPC2 - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, DETECTOR, PA_V3
for ACS - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, ORIENTAT 
for SPECIAL - INSTRUME, FILTER, POLANG, ORIENTAT
</pre>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1. To reduce a set of FOC aperture polarimetry data:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolpoints imalis=&quot;@focim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@focer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;foc-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; pointab=&quot;focap1.tab&quot;
    nrej=3 sigsky=2.5 outtab=&quot;focapol1&quot;
<p>
FOC polarization data usually consist of a set of three images 
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer of 0, 60 and 
120 degrees at approximately the same ORIENTAT. See the HST Data 
Handbook, Section 8-7).
<p>
2. To reduce a set of NICMOS polarimetry images in a set of
apertures:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolpoints imalis=&quot;@nicim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@nicer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;nicmos-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; pointab=&quot;nicap1.tab&quot;
    nrej=7 sigsky=3.0 outtab=&quot;nicpolap.tab&quot;
<p>
NICMOS polarization data usually consist of a set of three images
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer which are close
to 0, 120 and 240 degrees (depending on the polarizer used short 
(S) or long wavelength (L)) at a similar ORIENTAT. See the HST Data 
Handbook Section 18-12 and Hines, D. C., 1998, NICMOS and the VLT 
Workshop proceedings, eds. Freduling, W. &amp; Hook, R., p. 63.  
<p>
3. To reduce the aperture polarization for a set of WFPC2 
polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolpoints imalis=&quot;@wfpcim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@wfpcer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;wfpc2-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; pointab=&quot;wfpcap2&quot;
    nrej=1 sigsky=2.7 outtab=&quot;wfpc_1.tab&quot;
<p>
WFPC2 polarization data can consist of three or four images taken 
with three or four rotation angles of the polarizer quad filter at 
a given PA_V3, or three or more images taken on the same chip at 
differing values of PA_V3 and covering a range of rotation of at 
least 90 degrees. See the HST Data Handbook Section 28-16 and 
Biretta, J. &amp; McMaster, M., WFPC2 Instrument Science Report 97-11. 
The header parameters FILTNAM1 and FILTNAM2 are translated to 
provide the polarizer position angle in conjunction with the chip 
number (for POLQ only).
<p>
4. To reduce the aperture polarization for a set of ACS 
polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolpoints imalis=&quot;@acsim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@acser.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;acs-pol-hrc-v-filt-001.dat&quot; pointab=&quot;specaper.tab&quot;
    nrej=1 sigsky=3.0 outtab=&quot;acs_aper.tab&quot;
<p>
ACS polarization data usually consist of a set of three images
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer, which are
0, 60 and 120 degrees, for a given camera (WFC or HRC), 
polarizing filter (POLV or POLUV) and colour filter.
See the ACS Instrument Handbook, Chapter 5 for details.
<p>
5. To reduce a set of polarimetry images originating from a
non-HST instrument and determine the polarization for a set of 
sources:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolpoints imalis=&quot;@specim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@specer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;special-pol-001&quot; pointab=&quot;specaper.tab&quot;
    nrej=0 sigsky=0.0 outtab=&quot;specpol_2&quot;
<p>
If the parameter INSTRUME is set to SPECIAL then non-HST imaging 
polarimetry data can be reduced. The filter name given by the 
header parameter FILTER must match the name in the instrument 
table file. The polarizer angle is indicated by the header 
parameter POLANG. The instrument rotation is indicated by the 
ORIENTAT parameter which may need to be translated into the 
instrumental system.

<h1>BUGS</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Some care should be taken if ORIENTAT is much different between 
the input images and there is substantial instrumental polarization,
since the position angle of instrumental polarization is (probably)
fixed in the reference frame of the instrument. This situation is
not correctly handled.
