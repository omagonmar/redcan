(can be negative corresponding to left handed circular polarization).
The image must be of the same dimensions as the Stokes I one.
<dt>instr = &quot;&quot; [name]
<dd>

<dt>instpoltab = &quot;&quot; [table file name]
<dd>
Name of STSDAS table file giving the parameters for polarization 
determination for the instrument corresponding to the input 
images. The table lists the polarizer filter name, the polarizer 
angle, the transmission for the components parallel and 
perpendicular to the polarizer axis, the transmission of the s 
and p rays (parallel and perpendicular to the pick-off mirror surface 
for the WFPC2 case) and the retardation of the s ray relative to the 
p ray, the instrumental polarization and its instrumental position

seven signal and seven error files are produced corresponding
to all the allowed settings of the polarizer quad filter.
For a non-HST instrument the number produced depends on the
number of distinct angles in the instrument table file.
The files are distinguished by:

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
This task is a comprehensive tool for producing simulated raw images
and error frames for the HST instruments with imaging polarizer 
facilities (currently FOC, NICMOS and WFPC2 and in future ACS). A 
non-HST instrument can also be handled - called 'SPECIAL'. There are 
four required input images: total signal (Stokes I in instrumental 
units - e.g. ADU); percentage linear polarization; position angle 
of polarization (E) vector (in degrees); circular polarization 
(in percent). The latter is required since the reflection by the 
pick-off mirror for WFPC2 (and ACS) induces some retardance (see 
Biretta &amp; McMaster, WFPC2 ISR 97-11) and any input cirular 
polarization will affect the measurement of linear polarization.  
<p>
The name of the HST instrument (or SPECIAL), the name of the
polarizing filter, the name of the colour filter (if distinct
from the polarizing filter e.g. for FOC, WFPC2 and ACS) and the
instrument position angle (PA_V3 for HST instruments) are 
required to fully specify the instrument. For FOC three simulated 
images are produced corresponding to the polarizer angles of 0, 60 
and 120 degrees. For NICMOS three simulated images are formed with 
polarizer angles close to 0, 120 and 240 degrees but the exact 
values are set by the choice of filter (short wavelength `S' or
long wavelength `L'). For WFPC2 seven images are formed 
corresponding to the four angles of the POLQ configuration
(0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees) and the three other possibilites
(102, 15 and 117 degrees - see the WFPC2 Instrument Handbook
for details). For ACS three simulated images are formed 
corresponding to the polarizer angles 0, 60 and 120 degrees. 
For the SPECIAL instrument the number of
images is specified by the number of polarizer position entries
in the instrument specific table file. All output simulated
images have a corresponding error image.
<p>
The instrument specific parameters are matched with
values found in the instpoltab table file which is required to
set the instrument specific polarization parameters for
computing the Stokes parameter and linear polarization data.
The correction for polarizer transmission and pick-off mirror
induced polarization follows closely the treatment for WFPC2
by Biretta and McMaster (WFPC2 ISR 97-11). The instrumental
polarization is included for effects that are not collected by 
these distinct parameters.
<p>
The predicted signal for the given instrument configuration
is computed at the specified polarizer position angles
and written to the output files. From the electrons per ADU
conversion factor and the readout noise, Poissonian
errors are produced from the signal files, using a random 
number generator. Error frames produced with the same value 
of seed are identical. A constant (ADU) can be added to the 
simulated images to model an unpolarized component (e.g. sky
or detector background); the error frames take account of
this background.
<p>
The output files are distinguished by a three digit integer 
postfix for the polarizer position angle - thus the NICMOS
POL120S simulated image will have the postfix int116 and
the error image err116.

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1. To produce a set of FOC simulated polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolsim inint=&quot;focint.fits&quot; inpol=&quot;focpol.fits&quot; 
    inpopa=&quot;focpa.fits&quot; instr=&quot;FOC&quot; polname=&quot;&quot; filtname=&quot;F437M&quot;
    PA_V3=128.5 instpoltab=&quot;foc-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; unback=0.0
    e_adu=1.0 read_noise=0.0 seed=99 outroot=&quot;foc1&quot;
<p>
polname is not required since there is only one polarizer filter
for FOC. The FOC being a photon counting detector has zero 
read-out noise. Three output simulated images are produced:
foc1int000.fits, foc1int060.fits &amp; foc1int120.fits
and three error images:
foc1err000.fits, foc1err060.fits &amp; foc1err120.fits 
<p>
2. To produce a set of NICMOS simulated polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolsim inint=&quot;nic1int.fits&quot; inpol=&quot;nic1pol.fits&quot; 
    inpopa=&quot;nic1pa.fits&quot; instr=&quot;NICMOS&quot; polname=&quot;POL0S&quot; filtname=&quot;&quot; 
    PA_V3=30.0 instpoltab=&quot;nicmos-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; unback=1000.0
    e_adu=12.8 read_noise=30.0 seed=11 outroot=&quot;nic1&quot;
<p>
polname is specified as one of the short or longwavelength
filters. filtername is not required since there are no
separate colour filters for the polarimetry mode of NICMOS.
Three output simulated images are produced:
nic1int001.fits, foc1int116.fits &amp; nic1int258.fits
and three error images:
nic1err001.fits, nic1err116.fits &amp; nic1err258.fits 
<p>
3. To produce a set of WFPC2 simulated polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolsim inint=&quot;wfc1int.fits&quot; inpol=&quot;wfc1pol.fits&quot; 
    inpopa=&quot;wfc1pa.fits&quot; instr=&quot;WFPC2&quot; polname=&quot;POLQ&quot; 
    filtname=&quot;F555W&quot; PA_V3=173.3 
    instpoltab=&quot;wfpc2-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; unback=12.0
    e_adu=7.1 read_noise=5.2 seed=1 outroot=&quot;wfc1&quot;
<p>
Seven output simulated images are produced:
wfc1int000.fits, wfc1int015.fits, wfc1int045.fits, wfc1int090.fits
wfc1int102.fits, wfc1int117.fits &amp; wfc1int135.fits
and seven error images:
wfc1err000.fits, wfc1err015.fits, wfc1err045.fits, wfc1err090.fits
wfc1err102.fits, wfc1err117.fits &amp; wfc1err135.fits
<p>
4. To produce a set of ACS simulated polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolsim inint=&quot;acs1int.fits&quot; inpol=&quot;acs1pol.fits&quot; 
    inpopa=&quot;acs1pa.fits&quot; instr=&quot;ACS&quot; polname=&quot;POL0V&quot; filtname=&quot;F555W&quot; 
    PA_V3=30.0 instpoltab=&quot;acs-pol-wfc-v-filt-001.dat&quot; unback=1.0
    e_adu=1.0 read_noise=4.0 seed=7 outroot=&quot;acs1&quot;
<p>
polname is specified as either the visible (V) or ultra-violet (UV)
polarizing filter and filtname as one of the colour filters 
available with the chosen polarizer.  
Three output simulated images are produced:
acs1int000.fits, acs1int060.fits &amp; acs1int120.fits
and three error images:
acs1err000.fits, acs1err060.fits &amp; acs1err120.fits 
<p>
5. To produce a set of simulated polarimetry images for a 
non-HST instrument:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolsim inint=&quot;new1int.fits&quot; inpol=&quot;new1pol.fits&quot; 
    inpopa=&quot;new1pa.fits&quot; instr=&quot;SPECIAL&quot; polname=&quot;&quot; 
    filtname=&quot;FILT1&quot; PA_V3=0.0 instpoltab=&quot;special-pol-001.tab&quot; 
    unback=50.0 e_adu=2.0 read_noise=4.1 seed=7 outroot=&quot;spec1&quot;
<p>
polname is not used. filtname must correspond to the name
of the filter in the table file. The number of simulated images
depends on the number of entries in the table file. The integer
value of the polarizer angle distinguishes the different
output files. The header parameter FILTER provides the
filter name and POLANG the polarizer angle.
