<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>imalis = &quot;&quot; [list of file names]
<dd>
The list of input sky-subtracted images to be reduced. Upto
64 images can be input. They must all be of the same dimensions
and are assumed to be well aligned.

Name of STSDAS table file giving the parameters for polarization 
determination for the instrument corresponding to the input 
images. The table lists the polarizer filter name, 
the polarizer angle, the transmission for the
components parallel and perpendicular to the polarizer axis,
the transmission of the s and p rays (parallel and perpendicular
to the pick-off mirror surface for the WFPC2 case) and the retardation 
of the s ray relative to the p ray, the instrumental polarization and
its instrumental position angle.

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
This task is a comprehensive tool for producing reduced polarization images
for the HST instruments with imaging polarizer facilities (currently FOC, 
WFPC2, NICMOS and ACS). A non-HST instrument can also be 
handled - called 'SPECIAL'. The error frames are required to produce output 
error files and should contain all sources of error (photon noise, 
systematics (e.g. flat fielding errors) and read-out noise). 
<p>
All instrument specific parameters are picked up from the header and
the telescope rotation angle is read from the PA_V3 or ORIENTAT 
descriptor (see below for details and also examples).
The polarizer and or colour filter name in the header is matched with
values found in the instpoltab table file and these are used to
set the instrument specific polarization parameters required to
compute the Stokes parameter and linear polarization data.
The correction for polarizer transmission and pick-off mirror
induced polarization follows closely the treatment for WFPC2
by Biretta and McMaster (WFPC2 ISR 97-11). The instrumental
polarization is included for effects that are not
collected by these physically based parameters. If the values 
of the polarizer efficiences for calculating each Stokes parameter 
are equal for all input images (such as by specifying the same 
polarizer orientation and instrument position angle), then no 
calculation of polarization is possible. The task exits 
with an error in this case.
<p>
All errors are computed by Gaussian error propagation. To correct
for the bias in linear polarization values which occurs when
the Stokes parameter errors are large and the determination
of linear polarization is no longer Gaussian error dominated, 
the method advocated by Wardle &amp; Kronberg (ApJ, 194, 249, 
1974) is employed, using the solution of the Rice 
distribution (see also Simmons &amp; Stewart, A&amp;A, 142, 10, 1985 
for a discussion). Tests with synthetic data show that this 
correction does an adequate job to pol/sigma(pol) of about 2. Below 
that value it is best to use Monte Carlo methods which are not 
directly dealt with here. The method of computing the errors on 
the polarization position angle depends on the polarization
signal-to-noise (i.e. pol/sigma(pol)). If pol/sigma(pol) is
greater than 8 then the simple method (sigma(theta) =
28.65*sigma(pol)/pol) is employed (Serkowski, Adv. in Astron. &amp; 
Astrophys. 1, 289, 1962); if pol/sigma(pol) is
less than 8 then the distribution function of the position angle
errors is integrated to derive the 1 sigma error (see
Naghizadeh-Khouei &amp; Clarke, A&amp;A, 274, 968, 1993). Of course if
the input error frames are all zero, no correction for bias is 
performed and all output errors frames are set to zero. 
<p>
The output images can be rebinned in the two axis directions 
by an integer number. This permits the error per bin to be
reduced or the sampling to be matched to the 
resolution of the polarization maps. Individual pixel values in 
the input images can be rejected from inclusion in binned
data by setting the sigma rejection 
parameter to a low value. Some care should be exercised here
else valid points will be deleted from inclusion in the sum of
a binned region leading to a bias in Stokes parameter determination.
Largish values are useful for rejecting obvious artefacts such
as hot pixels or cosmic rays. For unbinned data this parameter
is ignored.
<p>
The bound to the maximum polarization error (%) in the output maps
acts to supress points with low signal-to-noise which will
produce wildly varying polarization values and position angles.
Output points with polarization error greater than this bound
have pixel values set to zero in all the output images.
<p>
On completion of the task the number of output pixels with 
small (less than 1.0E-10) or negative values which were
set to zero are printed to the terminal. The number 
of output pixels whose polarization error exceeded the maximum 
polarization error bound is also printed to the terminal.
<p>
The following header keywords are required in order that the 
instrumental polarization parameters can be matched against the
instrument table files:
<pre>
for FOC - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, ORIENTAT
for NICMOS - INSTRUME, FILTER, ORIENTAT
for WFPC2 - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, DETECTOR, PA_V3
for ACS - INSTRUME, FILTNAM1, FILTNAM2, ORIENTAT
for SPECIAL - INSTRUME, FILTER, POLANG, ORIENTAT

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1. To reduce a set of FOC polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolima imalis=&quot;@focim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@focer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;foc-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; xybin=1 binrej=10.
    errlim=2.0 outroot=&quot;foc001&quot;
<p>
FOC polarization data usually consist of a set of three images 
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer of 0, 60 and 
120 degrees at approximately the same orientation (ORIENTAT). See 
the HST Data Handbook, Section 8-7). 
<p>
2. To reduce a set of NICMOS polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolima imalis=&quot;@nicim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@nicer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;nicmos-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; xybin=2 binrej=5.
    errlim=3.0 outroot=&quot;nic001&quot;
<p>
NICMOS polarization data usually consist of a set of three images
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer which are close
to 0, 120 and 240 degrees (depending on the polarizer used short 
(S) or long wavelength (L)) at a similar ORIENTAT. See the HST Data 
Handbook Section 18-12 and Hines, D. C., 1998, NICMOS and the VLT 
Workshop proceedings, eds. Freduling, W. &amp; Hook, R., p. 63.  
<p>
3. To reduce a set of WFPC2 polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolima imalis=&quot;@wfpcim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@wfpcer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;wfpc2-pol-filt-001.tab&quot; xybin=2 binrej=20.
    errlim=5.0 outroot=&quot;wfpc001&quot;
<p>
WFPC2 polarization data can consist of three or four images taken 
with three or four rotation angles of the polarizer quad filter at 
a given PA_V3, or three or more images taken on the same chip at 
differing values of PA_V3 and covering a range of rotation of at 
least 90 degrees. See the HST Data Handbook Section 28-16 and 
Biretta, J. &amp; McMaster, M., WFPC2 Instrument Science Report 97-11. 
The header parameters FILTNAM1 and FILTNAM2 are translated to 
provide the polarizer position angle in conjunction with the chip 
number (for POLQ only).
<p>
4. To reduce a set of ACS polarimetry images:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolima imalis=&quot;@acsim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@acser.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;acs-pol-wfc-uv-filt-001.dat&quot; xybin=2 binrej=5.
    errlim=3.0 outroot=&quot;acs001&quot;
<p>
ACS polarization data usually consist of a set of three images
taken at the three rotation angles of the polarizer, which are
0, 60 and 120 degrees, for a given camera (WFC or HRC), 
polarizing filter (POLV or POLUV) and colour filter.
See the ACS Instrument Handbook, Chapter 5 for details.
<p>
5. To reduce a set of polarimetry images originating from a
non-HST instrument:
<p>
cl&gt; hstpolima imalis=&quot;@specim.lis&quot; errlis=&quot;@specer.lis&quot; 
    instpoltab=&quot;special-pol-001.tab&quot; xybin=1 binrej=5.
    errlim=0.5 outroot=&quot;spec001&quot;
<p>
If the parameter INSTRUME is set to SPECIAL then non-HST imaging 
polarimetry data can be reduced. The filter name given by the 
header parameter FILTER must match the name in the instrument 
table file. The polarizer angle is indicated by the header 
parameter POLANG. The instrument rotation is indicated by the 
ORIENTAT parameter which may need to be translated into the 
instrumental system.

<h1>Format of the Instrument specific table file</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
The STSDAS table file is a nine column file with the following
columns:
Name of colour/polarizing filter 
Position angle of polarizer filter
Normalised transmission parallel to polarizer axis 
Normalised transmission perpendicular to polarizer axis 
Reflectance of mirror E-vector parallel to surface (s wave)
Reflectance of mirror E-vector normal to surface (p wave) 
Retardance (deg.) of s wave relative to p wave  
Instrumental polarization (%) 
Position angle (deg.) of instrumental polarization (in 
instrument frame)
<p>
with the following column names and format:
FILTER     CH*16 
POLANG     R     F6.2
TRANSPAR   R     E10.4
TRANSPER   R     E10.4
REFLECTRS  R     F6.4
REFLECTRP  R     F6.4
RETARDPHI  R     F8.4
INSTPOL    R     F6.2
INSTPA     R     F6.2
<p>
Thus table files for different instruments can be produced for use 
with this routine.
</pre>
<p>
</blockquote>
<h1>TIMING</h1>
<blockquote>
The computing time requirements depend on the data values. Data with
uniformly high signal-to-noise runs through quickly. However if the
values of pol/sigma(pol) are low, then the computing time is
substantially increased, since the Rice distribution must be solved 
for the bias on the polarization values and, more specifically, the 
distribution on the position angle errors must be numerically 
integrated.
<p>
</blockquote>
<h1>BUGS</h1>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Some care should be taken if ORIENTAT is much different between 
the input images and there is substantial instrumental polarization,
since the position angle of instrumental polarization is (probably)
fixed in the reference frame of the instrument. This situation is
not correctly handled.
