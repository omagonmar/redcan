RVSAO -- An IRAF package to obtain radial velocities from spectra
 
The package RVSAO defined in this directory was developed by Doug Mink at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from the redshift package
originally written by Gerard Kriss at Johns Hopkins University and modified
significantly by Steve Levine at the University of Wisconsin.  It obtains
radial velocities and velocity dispersions using cross-correlation methods
or emission line fits.  It consists of eight tasks: XCSAO, EMSAO, PXCSAO,
PEMSAO, BCVCORR, SUMSPEC, LINESPEC, and EQWIDTH.

If you have any problems, please contact Doug Mink, mink@cfa.harvard.edu.

A task, RELEARN, has been provided to aid in updating parameters.  Run it
instead of UNLEARN to keep your current parameters settings while adding
new parameters.

A set of templates commonly used at the CfA is included in the Templates/
subdirectory.  Someday, there will be documentation about them.

After the Revision Notes, you will find installation instructions.

A fairly complete description of this package has been published in the
August 1998 issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific:

***************************************************************************

2.7.8, November 19, 2009
XCSAO, PXCSAO, EMSAO, PEMSAO: Zoom and line identification changes in emplot.x
LISTSPEC,PIX2WL,WL2PIX: Increase image string size to SZ_PATHNAME(511) from SZ_FNAME(255)
emplot.x: Fix zoom at left and right edges of a displayed spectrum.
          Replot immediately with new velocity if line selected
          Mark VELOCITY as being used if it is guessed from a line
emplot.x: zoom and line selection
getimage.x: Increase image string size to SZ_PATHNAME(511) from SZ_FNAME(255)

2.7.7, July 16, 2009
XCSAO: If DIVCONT is T in object spectrum, divide it by its continuum and
       subtract 1.0 instead of subtracting the continuum; do the same with
       all templates, if they have no SUBCONT flag.
XCSAO,EMSAO: If contspec.order is zero, do not remove continuum
XCSAO,EMSAO,SUMSPEC: If dividing continuum, normalize by mean of continuum
       to get the true variation in count rates.
EQWIDTH: Compute sigma according to John Huchra's new formula

2.7.6, June 15, 2009
WLRANGE: New task to return the overlapping wavelength range for a list of spect
ra

2.7.5, June 10, 2009
EQWIDTH: Major changes to make it more robust and handle rest wavelengths right
EMSAO, PEMSAO: Fix multiple aperture plotting so it doesn't crash or print blank
 lines
PEMSAO: Compute lambda/pix by offset from line center to avoid dividing by
        zero if line is exactly at rest wavelength (as for a sky or
        calibration lamp line)
SUMSPEC: Fix bugs so that rebinned wavelength range can be computed from
         overlap
emrslts.x: Return immediately if no log file is set
emplot.x: Get number of apertures from im structure, not smw
emlines.dat: Add Lyman Beta and Gamma; move Lyamn Alpha from 1215.7 to 1215.67
             Fix name of 1240.0 from LyA to NV

2.7.4, April 24, 2009
BCFCORR: Add SUBGRAV parameter to make solar gravitational redshift subtraction
         from twilight sky spectra optional
LISTSPEC: Allow multiple apertures and write them to separate files
EQWIDTH: Fix error computation for equivalent widths and indices
SUMSPEC: Handle spectra with PIXEL WCS correctly
getimage.x: Set RA, DEC, ST, HA to 0:00 if not in header [for shdr_open()]
juldate.x: Add MJD as possible JD header keyword; return hjd = jd if
           there is no pointing direction in the image header

2.7.3, March 31, 2009
Add new shell scripts in Shell/ to run most RVSAO tasks on the Unix/Linux
command line.

2.7.2, March 13, 2009
XCSAO: Add option to shift orders when cross-correlating echelle spectra

2.7.1, February 20, 2009
EMSAO,XCSAO: Assume RA is in degrees if decimal keyword value, not hours

2.7.0, January 30, 2009
SUMSPEC: Fix bug which put back heliocentric velocity correction when shifting
         to a specific velocity and delete IRAF WCS keywords if one spectrum
         is being rebinned.
EQWIDTH: Fix error of index so that it is at least closer to correct.
         Fix bug so that a lack of a VELOCITY or BCV keyword does not crash
         the program.  Clean up exposure scaling.

See the NEWS file for the earlier history of the software.

***************************************************************************

To install this package in your local IRAF system, take the following steps:
 
1)	The package is distributed as a tar archive; IRAF is distributed
	with a tar reader.  The tar archive may be obtained by magnetic
	tape or anonymous ftp.  For magnetic tape go to step [2] and when
	reading the tar archive simply mount the tape and use the tape
	device name for the archive name in step [4].  To obtain the package
	via ftp (assuming a UNIX computer):

	    % ftp cfa-ftp.harvard.edu
	    login: anonymous
	    password: [your user name]
	    ftp> cd pub/iraf
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.7.4.readme
	    ftp> binary
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.7.4.tar.gz
	    ftp> quit
	    % ls -l
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink          xxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.7.4.readme
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink        xxxxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.7.4.tar.gz
	    %

2)	Create a directory to contain the RVSAO external package files.  This
	directory should be outside the IRAF directory tree and must be owned
	by the IRAF account.  In the following examples, this root directory
	is /local/rvsao/.  Make the appropriate file name substitutions for
        your site.
 
3)	Log in as IRAF and edit the extern.pkg file in the hlib directory to
	define the package to the CL.  From the IRAF account, outside the CL,
	you can move to this directory with the command:

            % cd $hlib

	Define the environment variable rvsao to be the pathname to the rvsao
	root directory.  UNIX pathnames must be terminated with a '/'.
	Edit extern.pkg to include:

            reset rvsao	= <directory>/rvsao-2.7.4/
            task  rvsao.pkg   = rvsao$rvsao.cl

	or, to avoid conflicts with earlier versions or the IRAF rv package,

            reset r2rvsao	= <directory>/rvsao-2.7.4/
            task  r2rvsao.pkg   = r2rvsao$r2rvsao.cl
 
	Near the end of the hlib$extern.pkg file, update the definition
	of helpdb so it includes the rvsao help database, copying the syntax
	already used in the string.  Add this line before the line containing
	a closing quote:
 
	    ,rvsao$lib/helpdb.mip\

	or, if using r2rvsao,
 
	    ,r2rvsao$lib/helpdb2.mip\
 
4)      Add to hlib$clpackage.men the package description:
 
            rvsao - Radial velocity package from SAO
 
	or, if using r2rvsao,
 
            r2rvsao - Radial velocity package from SAO
 
5)	Unpack the tar file into the RVSAO root directory.

	On a UNIX system, where ftpdir is the pathname of the directory
	into which the package was ftp'ed and rvsao is the RVSAO root
	directory:
	    % cd $rvsao (or $r2rvsao)
	    % cd ..
	    % zcat $ftpdir/rvsao-2.7.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -

	The archive file can be deleted once the package has been
	successfully installed.
 
6)      Restart IRAF and "cd rvsao" or "cd r2rvsao".

7)	Symbolically link the appropriate binary directory to bin.
	bin is originally linked to bin.generic for distribution.

        On a SPARCstation running Solaris, type
	    cl> mkpkg ssun

        On a PC running Redhat Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg redhat

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X on an Intel processor, type
	    cl> mkpkg macintel

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X, type
	    cl> mkpkg macosx

        On a PC running Cygwin, type
	    cl> mkpkg cygwin

        On a PC running Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg linux

	For other architectures, make a directory of the proper bin.{arch}
	name, and link it to bin

8)      Make the package by typing
	    cl> mkpkg update >&spool

	The spool file should be reviewed upon completion to make sure
	there were no errors.

9)	Up-to-date hypertext help is available on the World Wide Web at
