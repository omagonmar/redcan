To install this package in your local IRAF system, take the following steps:
 
1)	The package is distributed as a tar archive; IRAF is distributed
	with a tar reader.  The tar archive may be obtained by magnetic
	tape or anonymous ftp.  For magnetic tape go to step [2] and when
	reading the tar archive simply mount the tape and use the tape
	device name for the archive name in step [4].  To obtain the package
	via ftp (assuming a UNIX computer):

	    % ftp cfa-ftp.harvard.edu
	    login: anonymous
	    password: [your user name]
	    ftp> cd pub/iraf
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.7.8.readme
	    ftp> binary
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.7.8.tar.gz
	    ftp> quit
	    % ls -l
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink          xxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.7.8.readme
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink        xxxxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.7.8.tar.gz
	    %

2)	Create a directory to contain the RVSAO external package files.  This
	directory should be outside the IRAF directory tree and must be owned
	by the IRAF account.  In the following examples, this root directory
	is /local/rvsao/.  Make the appropriate file name substitutions for
        your site.
 
3)	Log in as IRAF and edit the extern.pkg file in the hlib directory to
	define the package to the CL.  From the IRAF account, outside the CL,
	you can move to this directory with the command:

            % cd $hlib

	Define the environment variable rvsao to be the pathname to the rvsao
	root directory.  UNIX pathnames must be terminated with a '/'.
	Edit extern.pkg to include:

            reset rvsao	= <directory>/rvsao-2.7.8/
            task  rvsao.pkg   = rvsao$rvsao.cl

	Near the end of the hlib$extern.pkg file, update the definition
	of helpdb so it includes the rvsao help database, copying the syntax
	already used in the string.  Add this line before the line containing
	a closing quote:
 
	    ,rvsao$lib/helpdb.mip\

4)      Add to hlib$clpackage.men the package description:
 
            rvsao - Radial velocity package from SAO
 
5)	Unpack the tar file into the RVSAO root directory.

	On a UNIX system, where ftpdir is the pathname of the directory
	into which the package was ftp'ed and rvsao is the RVSAO root
	directory:
	    % cd $rvsao
	    % cd ..
	    % zcat $ftpdir/rvsao-2.7.8.tar.gz | tar xvf -

	The archive file can be deleted once the package has been
	successfully installed.
 
6)      Restart IRAF and "cd rvsao" or "cd r2rvsao".

7)	Using the appropriate mkpkg command below, symbolically link the
	appropriate binary directory to bin/.
	(bin/ is originally linked to bin.generic/ for distribution.)

        On a SPARCstation running Solaris, type
	    cl> mkpkg ssun

        On a PC running Redhat Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg redhat

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X on an Intel processor, type
	    cl> mkpkg macintel

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X, type
	    cl> mkpkg macosx

        On a PC running Cygwin, type
	    cl> mkpkg cygwin

        On a PC running Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg linux

	For other architectures, make a directory of the proper bin.{arch}
	name, and link it to bin

8)      Make the package by typing
	    cl> mkpkg update >&spool

	The spool file should be reviewed upon completion to make sure
	there were no errors.

9)	In addition to the IRAF help pages for each task, there is
	up-to-date hypertext help is available on the World Wide Web at
