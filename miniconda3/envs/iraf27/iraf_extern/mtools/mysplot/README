This directory contains the source for MYSPLOT, an extened version of IRAF's
ONEDSPEC.SPLOT task.  It is part of a larger package of tasks, however it can
be compiled and executed outside that package.  To do so, do the following:

1.  Compile the program
    
    cl> mkpkg

    Note the "prep:" section in the "mkpkg" file.  Since this task is just an
    extension of the IRAF ONEDSPEC.SPLOT task, it requires the ONEDSPEC
    "libpkg.a" file.  The "prep:" section is responsible for copying that
    library into this directory.  This operation can be site dependent,
    depending on how IRAF is installed at your site.  This part of the "mkpkg"
    file may need to be changed to suit your site.

2.  In your "loginuser" file, add the following two lines:

    set mysplot = "mysplot_directory/"
    task mysplot = mysplot$xx_mysplot.e

    where "mysplot_directory/" should be replaced with the appropriate path
    name.  It is necessary to define the IRAF enviroment variable "mysplot" so
    that the interactive help file ('?' keystroke) can be found.

3.  To get an on-line help manual for the task:

    cl> help mysplot$mysplot.hlp
