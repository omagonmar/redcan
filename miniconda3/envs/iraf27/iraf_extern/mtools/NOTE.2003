MTOOLS wouldn't completely recompile under PC-IRAF V2.12, under RedHat 7.3.
I had to make the following changes:

1) While it found the public defines in <pkg/gtools.h>, it wouldn't find
   the private defines.  I don't understand this.  However, the kludge is
   to copy iraf$pkg/xtools/gtools/gtools.h to mtools$chart and mtools$mysplot,
   then replace 'include <pkg/gtools.h>' with 'include "gtools.h"' in all
   *.x file in the chart and mysplot directories.

2) When compiling mysplot, it thought that many of the *.x files were older
   than there compiled versions in the library, and therefore didn't recompile
   them.  The fix was to "touch" all "*.x" file in the mysplot directory.
