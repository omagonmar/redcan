d	Apply new sample definitions.
f	Set "xcenter" and "ycenter" to the current cursor postion.
g	Redefine a graph key.
h-l	Graph keys.
m	Mark a data point (with a cross).
n	Show the number of data points in the current sample.
o	Toggle whether current graph key has square axes.

Additional commands are available for setting graph formats and manipulating
the graphics.  Use the following commands for help.

:/help			Print help for graph formatting option
:.help			Print help for general graphics options

In particular, the following GTOOLS commands change the specified parts of
the title string:
:/title			Selection criteria
:/subtitle		Marker definitions
:/comments		Sizing functions

3. INTERACTIVE CHART GRAPH KEYS

The graph keys are h, i, j, k, and l.  The graph keys may be redefined to
using the 'g' key.  To define a graph key select the desired key to redefine
and then specify a complete graph key description in the same format as used
for the graph key description file.  The format is:
	xfunction yfunction options
where the options can be any of the following:
	xsize	function		X-axis sizing function
	xsize	function		Y-axis sizing function
	xunits	string			X-axis units
	yunits	string			Y-axis units
	limits	xmin xmax ymin ymax	Graph window limits
	xflip				Flip the x-axis
	yflip				Flip the x-axis
	square				Square aspect ratio
