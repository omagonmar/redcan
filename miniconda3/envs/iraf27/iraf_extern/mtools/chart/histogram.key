1. INTERACTIVE HISTOGRAM CURSOR OPTIONS

?	Print options.
a	Toggle autoscaling of integer data.
d	Apply new sample definitions.
f	Change the function to bin.

2. INTERACTIVE HISTOGRAM COLON COMMANDS

The following colon command is available only from within the histogram
facility.

:list [filename]	List the  upper and lower bounds, and counts, for
			each bin.

In addition, the following colon commands are available here, as well as from
the main cursor.

The following  parameters are listed or set with the following commands which
may be abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

:nbins [value]			Number of bins in the histogram.
:z1 [value]			Minimum value in the histogram.
:z2 [value]			Maximum value in the histogram.
:cutoff1 [value]		First sample cutoff.
:cutoff2 [value]		Second sample cutoff.
:cutoff3 [value]		Third sample cutoff.
:cutoff4 [value]		Fourth sample cutoff.
:cX [value]			Abbreviated version of ":cutoffX" command.
:logic [value]			Logic used for combining all sample cutoffs.
:marker1 [value]		First special marker definition.
:marker2 [value]		Second special marker definition.
:marker3 [value]		Third special marker definition.
:marker4 [value]		Fourth special marker definition.
:mX [value]			Abbreviated version of ":markerX" command.
:def_marker [value]		Default marker.
:mmarker [value]		Marker type for marked objects.
:xsize [value]			Function used to determine x-axis marker sizes.
:ysize [value]			Function used to determine y-axis marker sizes.
:sorter [value]			Function used to sort output lists.
:field [value]			Field cutoff (none, celestial, or pds).
:xcenter [value]		RA or X of field center.
:ycenter [value]		DEC or Y of field center.
:radius [value]			Radius of field (positive for square field,
				negative for circular field).
:max_size [value]		Maximum marker size in NDC units.
:min_size [value]		Minimum marker size in NDC units.
:outformat [value]		File specifying output format.
:outliers [value]		Plot objects that are outside the graph limits.

Additional commands.

:show					Show all the selection parameters.
:all output_file [format_file]		Print data for all objects.
:marked output_file [format_file]	Print data for marked objects.
:unmarked output_file [format_file]	Print data for unmarked objects.
:gall [format_string] outputfile variable1 [variable2 ...]
					Print data for all objects.
:gmarked [format_string] outputfile variable1 [variable2 ...]
					Print data for marked objects.
:gunmarked [format_string] outputfile variable1 [variable2 ...]
					Print data for unmarked objects.
:rkeys [file]				Read graph key description file.
:wkeys [file]				Write graph key descriptions.
:replace file variable1 [variable2 ...]	Replace catalog entries.
:rmarks file				Read marked points from a file.

Additional commands are available for setting graph formats and manipulating
the graphics.  Use the following commands for help.

:/help			Print help for graph formatting option
:.help			Print help for general graphics options

In particular, the following GTOOLS commands change the specified parts of
the title string:
:/title			Selection criteria
:/subtitle		Selection criteria for overplotted histograms
:/comments		Histogram parameters
