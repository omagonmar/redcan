NAME
oview -- Quick view (display) of select frames in OSCIR image
.ih
USAGE
oview image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image = ""
Input image.  Operates on one image at a time.
.le
.ls type = "sig"
Frame type to be displayed.  Valid values are 
"ref1|ref2|src1|src2|dif1|dif2|sig|sigall"
.le
.ls delay = 0
Delay in seconds between display updates.
.le
.ls manual = no
Allows interactive (imexam) mode.  Available only for type="sig".
.le
.ls disp_fill = no
Option to force image to fill display.  Slows down execution.
.le
.ls test_mode = no
If test mode flag is set, prints timing messages during execution.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Prints nodset, saveset values for each display.  Useful for identifying
location of frames of interest, particularly with type="sig"; however, 
with other types can produce a lot of output and slow down execution.

.ih
DESCRIPTION

Displays all frames of \fItype\fR "type" for given OSCIR image.
Frames are displayed on ximtool or similar display, which
must already be running in the session.  Images are displayed
sequentially, with a \fIdelay\fR of "delay" between each update.
Depending on the size of the file, displaying "ref", "src"
and "dif" frame types can typically display hundreds of frames.
Number of displayed frames = n_nodset*n_saveset.  For 
type="sig", only one frame per nodset is displayed, which
is the combined "dif" frames of all savesets in that nodset
(see oscirinfo for more information).  For type="sig", if
"manual=yes", display starts interactive "imexam" session
with each image, requiring user to enter "q" before the
next image is displayed.  No information is logged.

2.  Display all reference images from Nod position A and print nodset,saveset 
values.
.sp
.nf
    cl> oview 00dec03_018 type="ref1" verbose+

3.  Display all difference images from Nod position B.
