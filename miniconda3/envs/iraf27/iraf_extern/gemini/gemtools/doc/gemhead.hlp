DESCRIPTION
GEMHEAD uses IMHEAD to list the header content of the PHU and of
all image extensions in a MEF file. Minimal checking is done,
and the task therefore exits non-gracefully for some non-valid
input. 
GEMHEAD also works on simple FITS files.

Extensions that are binary tables will not be listed. Instead GEMHEAD
will give the output "Illegal image type (extension)" for these 
extensions.
