NAME
ldisplay -- Display hexagonal geometry IFU's 
.ih
USAGE
ldisplay input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input = "ldispdemo$spiral.ms"
Input IFU data.  This is a multispec spectral file, a text file containing
flux values, or a raw 2D fibre image.  For text file input the spectral
plotting options are not available.  For raw 2D fibre image input the quick
look parameters are used to create a quick extraction of the fibre data.
.le
.ls band = 1
Band number to use in input multispec file.
.le

.ls output = "ldisplay"
Temporary lens array image to be created.  If this image exists, say from
a previous execution, it will be replaced.
.le
.ls siz = 512 (128-2048)
Size of out lens array image.
.le
.ls title = "Lens array output"
Title for the output lens array image.
.le

.ls ldispdir = "ldispdemo$"
Directory for configuration files.
.le
.ls lconf = "spiral.cfg"
Configuration file containing lens array geometry.
.le
.ls deadfibs = ""
Configuration file with locations of dead fibres.
.le
.ls lscale = 0.7
Centre to centre (arcsec) lenslet distance.
.le
.ls xflip = no
Flip lens array image about the x-axis?"
.le
.ls yflip = no
Flip lens array image about the y-axis?"
.le
.ls axisflip = no
Flip the lens array image about the x=y axis?
.le

.ls disqu = yes
Automatically display the lens array image?
.le
.ls display = "display frame=1 image="
Command to display lens array image.
.le
.ls imagecur = ""
Image cursor input.  If no value is given the image display cursor
is used otherwise the specified file is read.
.le
.ls device = "stdgraph"
Graphics device (usually STDGRAPH)
.le
.ls graphcur = ""
Graphics cursor input.  If no value is given the graphics cursor
is used otherwise the specified file is read.
.le

The following parameters perform a quick extraction of fibre data from
a raw two dimensional exposure.
.ls quick = no
Quick reduction of input fibre file?
.le
.ls flatfield = ""
Optional raw flat-field fibre file.
.le
.ls qfibres = 100
Number of fibres in flat field.
.le
.ls wfibres = 3
Width in pixels of single fibre.
.le
.ls firfib = 33
Row number of first fibre.
.le
.ls lasfib = 251
Row number of last fibre.
.le
.ls dispaxis = 1
Dispersion axis of image.
.le

DESCRIPTION
Using a user-specified configuration file, a hexagonal array is drawn and
output to an image. The intensities of individual lenses are specified by
some determined quantity from an input multispec file, or in quick look
mode, with a data image or/and a flat field image.

The aim is to interact with the user and easily produce plots of emission
line strengths or whatever.

EXAMPLES
1.  Display and interact with the demonstration data.  This data was
take with the SPIRAL IFU system.

.nf
    cl> ldisplay ldispdemo$spiral.ms ldisp=ldispdemo$ lconf=spiral.cfg
    Found 37 lens positions in the file 'ldispdemo$spiral.cfg' 
    img_setup: I've found a file called 'ldisplay'.
    img_setup: I am overwriting new image on that.

    img_setup: Making the new image...
    img_setup: Created new file 'ldisplay' with size [512,512]
    displhex: Executing the cl command:'display frame=1 image=ldisplay'
    z1=0. z2=106292.9

    [IFU hexagonal lenslet array is displayed and the image
    cursor is
     enabled for input.  Type '?' to get a short listing of
     image cursor commands.  Move the image cursor to a lenslet
     and type ' ' (space bar).  A spectrum is shown.  Type 'c'
     in the image display on the lenslet.  The graphics cursor
     is now enabled.  Type 'c' at two points in the spectrum.
     The flux between those points for each lenslet spectrum is
     summed and a new image is displayed.  Exit with 'q'.]
.fi

2.  The demonstration data also includes a text file with fluxes and
a configuration file for COHSI.

.nf
    cl> ldisplay ldispdemo$cohsi_test.dat ldisp=ldispdemo$ lconf=cohsi.cfg
.fi
