PARAMETERS
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile.  If the logfile in not specified by the other GEMLOG
tasks (GLOGINIT, GLOGPRINT, GLOGCLOSE), the value of this parameter will be
used.  See the help on GLOGINIT for further details.

.ls fl_stat_level = yes
Write the "status" level log entries to the Gemini log file.
.le
.ls fl_tsk_level = yes
Write the "task" level log entries to the Gemini log file.
.le
.ls fl_sci_level = yes
Write the "science" level log entries to the Gemini log file.
.le
.ls fl_eng_level = yes
Write the "engineering" level log entries to the Gemini log file.
.le
.ls fl_vis_level = yes
Write the "visual" (readability) level log entries to the Gemini log file.

DESCRIPTION
The GLOGPARS pset allows the user of a Gemini task implementing GEMLOG to 
select which categories of entries to write to the log file.  A task 
implementing GEMLOG has all the information necessary to write all types of 
entries, it is up to the user of that task to decide which logs s/he wants.  
In most cases, however, it is recommended to let the task write all entries 
and to review the log file using GLOGEXTRACT.  GLOGEXTRACT can "extract", from 
a Gemini log file, entries based on the user's selection criteria. 
.sp
There are 5 categories of log entries, which we will refer to as "log entry
levels".  The levels are "status", "task", "science", "engineering", and
"visual".  The log entry levels are defined as follow:
.ls status
Entries related to the execution status of the task.  For example:
.sp
.nf
  - Open and close logfile messages
  - Exit status of the task (success or failure?)
  - Error and warning messages
  - General 'processing' messages.
       o "Processing image N20031109S0058 ..."
       o "Finished processing image N20031109S0058"
  - Fork messages, i.e. when calling a child process, or when returning
    from a child process.
.fi
.sp
The "status" level entries will often have a date/time information.  The
associated descriptor, written at the beginning of each line, is "STAT".
.sp
Examples:
.nf
  STAT MPREPARE Log opened at [Wed 16:01:45 28-Apr-2004]
  STAT MPREPARE Log closed at [Wed 16:02:03 28-Apr-2004]

  STAT MPREPARE Exit status: SUCCESS

  STAT MPREPARE Processing 7 files ...
  STAT MPREPARE Finished with image 1 at [Wed Apr 28 16:01:48 HST 2004]
.fi
.le
.ls task
Entries related to the task's inputs and outputs.  The list of task input 
parameters and values should be given a "task" level.  Other examples would be 
any logs concerning input or output files.  The associated descriptor, written 
at the beginning of each line, is "TSK".
.sp
Examples:
.nf
  TSK  MPREPARE Input Parameters:
  TSK  MPREPARE      inimages   = N*.fits
  TSK  MPREPARE      rawpath    = 
  TSK  MPREPARE      outimages  = 
  TSK  MPREPARE      outprefix  = m
  TSK  MPREPARE      logfile    = 
  TSK  MPREPARE      sci_ext    = SCI
  TSK  MPREPARE      key_sat    = SATURATI
  TSK  MPREPARE      key_filter = FILTER
  TSK  MPREPARE      database   = midir$midir.dat
  TSK  MPREPARE      verbose    = yes

  TSK  MPREPARE     input file    ->    output file
  TSK  MPREPARE N20031109S0058.fits[0] -> mN20031109S0058.fits
.fi
.le
.ls science
Entries related to scientifically useful information, like the gain used, the
scale factors in IMCOMBINE, image statistics, etc.   The associated 
descriptor, written at the beginning of each line, is "SCI".
.sp
Examples:
.nf
  SCI  GGAIN gN20011221S139.fits[SCI,1]: EEV 9273-16-03, right 2.1 3.5
  SCI  GGAIN gN20011221S139.fits[SCI,2]: EEV 9273-20-04, right 2.337 3.3
  SCI  GGAIN gN20011221S139.fits[SCI,3]: EEV 9273-20-03, left  2.3 3.

  SCI  GEMCOMBINE                 Images     Exp   Mean  Scale
  SCI  GEMCOMBINE   gsN20011221S139.fits[SCI,1]   3.0  18079.  1.000
.fi
.le
.ls engineering
Entries providing details that are not essential to the review of a successful
process, or entries that do not fit in the other categories.  Those entries
would be useful to track down a problem when something goes wrong.  The
associated descriptor, written at the beginning of each line, is "ENG".
.sp
Examples:
.nf
  ENG  MPREPARE Rearranged image for nod 1
  
  ENG  GSCUT Slit 4: slit height = 101
.fi
.le
.ls visual
Entries that improve readability, like empty lines and strings of '-'.  Those
entries do not contain any information, except the name of the task
that had it written.  The associated descriptor, written at the beginning of 
each line, is "VIS".
.sp
Example:
.nf
   VIS  MPREPARE --------------------

EXAMPLE
1. Below is a section of a Gemini logfile.  Note that, although 
human-readable, the Gemini logfile is mostly meant to be examined with 
GLOGEXTRACT.
