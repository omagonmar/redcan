DESCRIPTION
GLOGFIX is used to fix a Gemini log file by adding missing EOE (End-of-Entries)
tags.  When a task is interrupted, because of a crash or a Control-C for 
example, the GEMLOG closing comments, the comments stating the success or
failure of the task, will most likely not be written to the 
log file.  Therefore, the BOE (Beginning-of-Entries) and EOE tags will no 
longer match.  The task GLOGEXTRACT relies on those tags to find its way 
through a Gemini log file.  By adding the missing EOE tags, GLOGFIX 
ensures that the subsequent log entries will be interpreted correctly by 
GLOGEXTRACT.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
GLOGFIX is not smart enough to know exactly which EOE tags are missing.  It 
simply counts the number of BOE tags and appends EOE tags to the end of the 
logfile to match the number BOE tags.  Because of that GLOGEXTRACT might not 
work very well on the log entries _preceding_ the fix.
