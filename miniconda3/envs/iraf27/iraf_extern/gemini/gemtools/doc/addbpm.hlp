NAME
addbpm -- Add DQ extensions from one MEF file (eg. a BPM) to another
.ih
USAGE
addbpm inimages bpm
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
Multi-extension FITS image, or list of images, to which the DQ extensions
of the \fIbpm\fR file will be added (either appended or bitwise ORed with any
existing DQ).
.le
.ls bpm 
Input BPM (or other reference file) in multi-extension FITS format,
containing DQ image extensions to be copied to \fIinimages\fR.
.le
.ls logfile = "gemtools.log"
Name of the output logfile (GEMEXTN).
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages to the screen as well as the log? Errors will be printed
regardless.

DESCRIPTION

ADDBPM is a simple MEF-file-handling wrapper that copies data quality
extensions from one file (such as a MEF-format BPM) to another. If
\fIinimages\fR already contains DQ extensions, the output is the bitwise
OR of those extensions with the DQ from \fIbpm\fR.

.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Append a previously generated MEF BPM to some GMOS science exposures:

.nf
  cl> addbpm rg@sci.lis bpm_1x1
.fi

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
This task does very limited error checking so is expected to crash under
some error conditions, such as when the number of SCI and DQ extensions
don't match; it has undergone limited testing after inclusion from the
experimental gmosifudr version on the Gemini Data Reduction User Forum.
It should arguably generate a new output file instead of modifying
its input (albeit only the DQ array). The behaviour may be modified in
future but in the meantime this is included as-is for user convenience.
