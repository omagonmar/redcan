NAME
glogclose -- Close a Gemini log file
.ih
USAGE
glogclose logfile curtask fl_success
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls logfile
The name of the Gemini logfile.  It should be the same as the logfile name used
by GLOGINIT when the log file was opened and initialized.
.le
.ls curtask
The name of the current task, i.e. the name of the task calling GLOGCLOSE. This
name will be added to the log entries
.le
.ls fl_success
Was the calling task, \fIcurtask\fR, successful?
.le
.ls glogpars = ""
The name of the text file containing the Gemini logging preferences parameters. 
The parameters relating to the entry levels to be written are found here.  If
\fIglogpars\fR is undefined then the default parameter set in the uparm 
directory is used.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print log entries to the screen as well as to the logfile.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if GLOGCLOSE halted with an error.  This
parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
GLOGCLOSE is used to write, to a Gemini log file, the exit status of a task, the
time and date at which the task exited, and a end-of-entries (EOE) tag used by
GLOGEXTRACT.

The exit status, for the task specified in \fIcurtask\fR, is "SUCCESS" if
\fIfl_success\fR is 'yes'.  Otherwise, the exit status is "FAILURE".

The exit status entry, and the date and time entry, are both given a 'Status' 
log level (see GEMLOGPARS for definitions).  Those two entries will therefore be 
omitted if \fIgemlogpars.fl_status\fR is set to no.  The 'end-of-entries' tag, 
however, is required by GLOGEXTRACT, and will always be written to the log file
(but never written to the standard output).

EXAMPLES
In the examples below, the program mode syntax is used as GLOGCLOSE will
most often be used in a procedure script.  Indeed, by its very nature, 
GLOGCLOSE has a limited pratical use in command mode (CL prompt).
.sp
1. Close a Gemini log file opened earlier with GLOGINIT.  Here, the exit 
status of the calling task, MPREPARE, is successful.
.sp
.nf
   glogclose( "midir.log", "mprepare", fl_success=yes)
.fi
.sp
This will append the following lines to "midir.log":
.sp
.nf
    STAT MPREPARE Exit status: SUCCESS
    STAT MPREPARE Log closed at [Wed 16:02:03 28-Apr-2004]
    EOE  MPREPARE 2004-04-28T16:02:03
    VIS
.fi
.sp
and the following lines to the screen:
.sp
.nf
    MPREPARE Exit status: SUCCESS
    MPREPARE Log closed at [Wed 16:02:03 28-Apr-2004]
    <empty line>
.fi
.sp
The 'EOE' line marks the end of a log block.  This is used by GLOGEXTRACT.
