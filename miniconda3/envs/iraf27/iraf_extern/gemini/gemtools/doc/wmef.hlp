NAME
wmef -- convert individual FITS or PLIO (.pl) files to a MEF file
.ih
USAGE
wmef input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
A comma separated list of input files in the order that they should
appear in the output Multi-Extension Fits (MEF) file. The input 
files should either be
FITS or PLIO (.pl) files. Input files cannot be MEF files but can
either be extensions in existing MEF files or simple FITS files. 
In the former case the extension
should be included as part of the file name in \fIinput\fR.
The .fits and .pl extensions may be omitted as long as other images
with the same root name do not exist in the directory.
Image sections are not accepted as input images.
.le
.ls output
The name of the output MEF file. The output file cannot contain a
character "[".
.le
.ls extnames = "SCI,VAR,DQ"
The names of the extensions in the MEF file to be put in the header
keyword EXTNAME. There should be the same
number of extension names as number of input files. If they
differ, the output extensions will not be named.
The default value contains the names that will be used for NIRI data.
.le
.ls phu = "dummy"
The source of the header information to be included in the Primary
Header Unit (PHU). For the default value a PHU will be created to 
serve as a wrapper for the extensions. \fIphu\fR may also be the
PHU from an already existing MEF file in which case the name of the 
file may be given with or without the "[0]" extension number.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Verbose output.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status. A value of 0 after the execution of the task shows that
the conversion was successful. Any other value reflects an error.
.le

DESCRIPTION
WMEF is a task that creates a Multi-Extension Fits (MEF) (\fIoutput\fR)
from individual files, \fIinput\fR.  

The \fIinput\fR files can be either FITS or PLIO (.pl masks) files.
The task will stop if any other format is supplied.
The FITS files may either be simple FITS or extensions in MEF files.
In the latter case the extension number should be included in the
\fIinput\fR list.
Image sections cannot be specified for the input files.

For NIRI data WMEF is used to assemble the data, variance and data 
quality planes into one MEF file. In this case
the extensions are named as follows.
.nf
   [1] is named [SCI] and contains the data
   [2] is named [VAR] and contains the variance
   [3] is named [DQ] and contains the data quality
.fi

The \fIoutput\fR file contains all information from the input files,
headers and data.
In addition, \fIphu\fR specifies the source of the PHU as extension [0]
in an existing MEF file. If \fIphu\fR=dummy, a wrapper PHU is created.

Any PLIO input files are stored as short integers in the MEF file.
All other data types are preserved from the input files.

EXAMPLES
1. Create a MEF file with three NIRI files containing the data, 
the variance and the data quality information:

.nf
    cl> wmef data.fits,var.fits,dq.pl niridata
.fi

2. Create a MEF file with three NIRI files containing the data, 
the variance and the data quality information using the header
information of a different fits file as the PHY:

.nf
    cl> wmef data.fits,var.fits,dq.pl niridata phu=niriraw.fits
.fi

3. Create a MEF file with named extensions from three GMOS data 
files and a binary FITS table:

.nf
    cl> wmef ccd1.fits,ccd2.fits,ccd3.fits,masktab.fits gmosdata \
        extnames="SCI1,SCI2,SCI3,MASKDEF"
.fi

4. Create a MEF file from extensions of other MEF files:

.nf
    cl> wmef niriA[1],niriB[2],niriC[3] nirioutput 
.fi
