DESCRIPTION
GEMQA is used to add the four header keywords that contain the results
of the final Gemini data quality assessment. GEMQA is used by the 
Gemini Staff and will only be used for the reduced co-added images.

GEMQA adds the following keywords to the header:

.nf
FINALINT= 'pass    '           / Requested total integration time
FINALIQ = 'pass    '           / Requested final image quality
PICONFIG= 'pass    '           / Requested instrument configuration
PITARGET= 'pass    '           / Requested target
.fi

The values may be "pass" or "fail".

Also, GEMQA appends data processing tags, namely the image name prefix 
and suffix, to the value of DATALAB to give each image a unique 
identifier.
