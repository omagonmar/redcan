GEMINI (Mar2002)         Gemini IRAF package v1.3       GEMINI (Mar2002)

Release date: March 5, 2002

This document describes the revisions relative to the Gemini IRAF package v1.2


PRIMARY REVISIONS:

1) Tasks for reduction of GMOS data (imaging, longslitand MOS). A new
   package "gmos" is included.
2) Bug fixes and performance improvements to the NIRI imaging tasks in
   the "niri" package.
3) Support tasks for the "gmos" package included in the "gemtools" package

  A new package "gmos" is released. It contains tasks for reduction of data 
  from GMOS. The release includes tasks for reduction of imaging, longslit
  and MOS data. A description of the GMOS data format is available as the 
  task "gmosinfo". This task also describes tasks that are used for both 
  imaging and spectroscopy data. The tasks "gmosinfoimag" and "gmosinfspec"
  describe typical reductions of imaging and spectroscopy data, respectively.

niri
  All tasks in the "niri" package should be unlearned prior to use in order
  to implement new parameters and default parameter values.

niri.nprepare
  Task revised to handle modifications to the NIRI array controller (older
  data is still handled correctly by nprepare).  nprepare has been 
  restructured to run much more quickly.

niri.nifastsky
  Minor modification to automatically generate an output file name.

niri.nisky
  Bugs fixed to allow nisky to work better on sky flats and images without
  bad pixel masks.  Minor modification to automatically generate an output 
  file name.
  
niri.niflat
  Bugs fixed in the sky flat code.  Header information is written all at
  once to improve speed.  Minor modification to automatically generate
  output image name.

niri.nireduce
  Simplified parameters considerably by restricting nireduce to one filter.
  Now only one flat field image is specified at a time.  Other parameters
  modified to simplify normal use.

gemtools.imcoadd
  Generalized for images with different gain/ron.

gemtools.gemhedit
  Minor bug fixes.

gemtools.gextverify (hidden task)
gemtools.gemhead
gemtools.gemcombine
  Generic tasks for support of tasks in the "gmos" package have been added to
  the "gemtools" package.
