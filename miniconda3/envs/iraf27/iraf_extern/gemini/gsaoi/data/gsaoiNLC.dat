# Database file containing non-linear correction coefficients for the GSAOI
# instrument 
####

# These are the non-linear parameters for each array as derived using
# the GNIRS equivalent method - the correction is a quadratic fit
# a+b*cts+c*cts*cts - no normalization applied (not using irlincor).
# Note that the applied correction is actually a third order poly.

# NOTE: If separate NLC is required below 2000 ADU, then add more lines with a
# distinguishing column (that should be also added to the lines below)

# RANGE designates the ADU range to which the coefficients should be
# applied. ALL is all; LOW is < 2000 ADU; HIGH is >= 2000 ADU.
