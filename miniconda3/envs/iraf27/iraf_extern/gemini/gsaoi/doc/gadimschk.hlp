NAME
gadimschk -- Check region of GSAOI image against another, including
             statistics sections.
.ih
USAGE
gadimschk inimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage
Input GSAOI image to check region against. Only one extension of an image
allowed. Full name only, no wild cards allowed. Image name must include
extension designation, i.e., extension index or EXTNAME and EXTVERSION. Region
to be checked must also be included, although if if entire region of input
image is to be checked then the section can be omitted. The region specified
will be checked against the dimensions of the input image. If the specified
region does not lie within the bounds of the image the task will halt with an
error.
.le
.ls section = ""
Area of input image to check and then compare to \fIchkimage\fR. Allowed
syntax, i.e., standard and non-standard IRAF syntax, can be found in the help
for GEMSECCHK.
.le
.ls chkimage = ""
Second image against which the region of \fIinimage\fR is to be compared. Only
one extension of an image allowed. Full name only, no wild cards allowed. Image
name must include extension designation, i.e., extension index or EXTNAME and
EXTVERSION.
.le
.ls key_check = "CCDSEC" (CCDSEC|DETSEC)
Image header keyword to perform the comparison with.
.le
.ls out_chkimage = ""
This is the output parameter for this task and should not be altered by the
user. \fIout_chkimage\fR contains the section of \fIchkimage\fR that represents
the same area as that designated by the area of \fIinimage\fR. If the entire
area of \fIchkimage\fR matches the region specified by \fIinimage\fR then
"[*,*]" will be appended to the output name, i.e., a section will always be
returned. However, should the area specified by \fIinimage\fR not lie wholly
within \fIchkimage\fR the task will halt with an error.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes use of the logfile
defined by gsaoi.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted
with an error. This parameter is set by the task and should not be
modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION

GADIMSCHK checks the region specified by \fIinimage\fR against the dimensions
of the extension specified by \fIinimage\fR to make sure that the region is
within the bounds of the input extension. If not, the task will halt with an
error.

Should an image and extension be supplied in the \fIchkimage\fR parameter, then
the region of the extension specified by \fIinimage\fR will be compared against
the extension specified by \fIchkimage\fR. The comparison is done in the frame
of reference by the header keyword specified by \fIkey_check\fR. If the region
of \fIinimage\fR is wholly within \fIchkimage\fR then the region of
\fIchkimage\fR which it describes (including the input \fIchkimage\fR name) is
returned by the \fIout_chkimage\fR parameter. Should it not be wholly within
\fIchkimage\fR then the task will halt with an error.

EXAMPLES

.nf
   cl> gadimschk S20120101S001.fits[1][*,50:2500]
.fi

As the maximum array dimensions of this image extension are 2048x2048
(full-frame) gadimschk will halt with an error as the section specified does
not lie wholly within the dimensions of the extension supplied.

.nf
   cl> gadimschk S20120101S001.fits[1] \
           chkimage=gsaoi$data/gsaoibpm_high_full.fits[DQ,1]
.fi

The \fIchkimage\fR is the static BPM supplied with the GSAOI package. The input
image is still full-frame. The dimensions in the coordinate reference CCDSEC of
the input extension and the input \fIchkimage\fR match exactly. Therefore, the
output parameter will be:

\fIout_chkimage\fR=gsaoi$data/gsaoibpm_high_full.fits[DQ,1][*,*]


.nf
   cl> gadimschk gS20120101S001.fits[SCI,1][100:1000,50:2000] \
           chkimage=gsaoi$data/gsaoibpm_high_full.fits[DQ,1]
.fi

The image has now been prepared and trimmed, meaning the dimensions no longer
match those of the \fIchkimage\fR exactly. However, they still lie wholly
within the dimensions of \fIchkimage\fR. Therefore, the output parameter will
be:

\fIout_chkimage\fR=gsaoi$data/gsaoibpm_high_full.fits[DQ,1][105:1005,55:2005]
