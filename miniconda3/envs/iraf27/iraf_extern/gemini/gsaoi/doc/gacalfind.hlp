NAME
gacalfind -- Find master dark and flat frames
.ih
USAGE
gacalfind inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
List of master dark and or flat GSAOI images. Can be a list of image names or
numbers (comma separated or @ lists), or a range of images numbers - wild
cards are supported. The image names may include the directory path. The images
must be in multi-extension FITS (MEF) format. The file extension ".fits" may or
may not be included. (See help for GAIMCHK for examples of all syntax allowed.)
.le
.ls calpath = "./"
Location of input calibrations images
.le
.ls caltable = "gsaoical.fits"
Name of output table with calibration information. Written to the local working
directory.
.le
.ls fl_calrun = no
If \fIcaltable\fR already exists re-create it?
.le
.ls fl_find = no
Return an appropriate calibration specified by \fIcaltype\fR for the image
specified by \fIsciimg\fR?
.le
.ls caltype = "" (""|DARK|FLAT<{DOME|TWLT|GCAL}>)
If \fIfl_find\fR=yes, this specifies which type of calibration to return. For
flats an additional string can be appended to "FLAT" to specify the type of
flat to find, e.g., \fIcaltype\fR="FLAT{TWLT}", will find only master flats
created  using twilight flats.
.le
.ls sciimg = ""
Science image for which to return and appropriate calibration.
.le
.ls out_calimg = ""
The requested calibration for \fIsciimg\fR. This is an output parameter for
this task and should not be set by the user.
.le
.ls maxtime = INDEF
Maximum time difference between calibration observation and current image to be
reduced. Used to select closest in time calibrations if more than one suitable
calibration of a given type is found.
.le
.ls ignore_nlc = no
Ignore any differences in the non-linearity correction states of calibrations
found and \fIsciimg\fR?
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
Name of the MEF extension containing the science data.
.le
.ls var_ext = "VAR"
Name of the MEF extensions containing the calculated variance planes.
.le
.ls dq_ext = "DQ"
Name of the MEF extensions containing the data quality information.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes use of the logfile
defined by gsaoi.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted
with an error. This parameter is set by the task and should not be
modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION

GCALFIND will search \fIcalpath\fR for master dark and flat frames and upon
request return a suitable calibration file of \fIcaltype\fR for the specified
input frame \fIsciimg\fR. calibration files that have the same ROI take
precedence. If more than one file matches the requested \fIcaltype\fR the one
closest in time will be chosen.

A specific type of flat can be requested by specifying the flat type when
requesting, e.g., \fIcaltype\fR="FLAT{DOME}". Allowed types are DOME, TWLT and
GCAL.
