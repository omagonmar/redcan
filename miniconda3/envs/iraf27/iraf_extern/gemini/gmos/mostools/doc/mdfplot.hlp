NAME
mdfplot -- Plot Mask Definition File
.ih
USAGE
mdfplot intable instrume
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls intable
Mask Definition File (MDF) file to be plotted. The MDF is the 
FITS file distributed with MOS data for GMOS and Flamingos-2.
.le
.ls instrume
Name of the Instrument to use. The choices are GMOS-N, GMOS-S, 
and F2.
.le
.ls fl_ps = yes
Make PostScript file of the plot on disk.
Setting \fIfl_inter\fR = no and \fIfl_ps\fR = no produces no output.
.le
.ls barcode = "default"
Assign barcode automatically based on the name of the MDF.
This parameter is primarily used by Gemini staff internally when
assigning barcodes to the GMOS and F2 masks. The barcode is shown
on the plot, but has otherwise no use for the off-site user.
.le
.ls fl_inter = yes
Examine plot interactively by giving the user a graphics cursor
after the plot has been made.
Setting \fIfl_inter\fR = no and \fIfl_ps\fR = no produces no output.
.le
.ls fl_over = yes
Allow the task to overwrite an existing PostScript file on disk.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the
logfile defined by mostools.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the 
task and should not be modified by the user.

DESCRIPTION
MDFPLOT provides a way to visualize the Mask Definition Files (MDF) distributed
with MOS data from GMOS-N and GMOS-S and F2 (Flamingos-2)
The task makes a plot of the mask frame (thick solid line) with the MOS field 
shown (thick dashed lines). The slits (usually small rectangles) are plotted 
in the correct size relative to the mask size.  Tilted slits are shown 
correctly.  The two circles in the right hand side of the GMOS plots are the 
mask registration holes used to mount the mask in the frame.

This task uses Igi language commands to draw the MOS masks for GMOS and F2. 
The files are mdfplot.igi for GMOS and mdfplotf2 for F2.

Columns from the MDFs may also be plotted versus each other using
GEMTOOLS.MGOGRAPH
