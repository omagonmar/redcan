NAME
gmskimg -- Create a pseudo-GMOS/F2 image for use with GMMPS
.ih
USAGE
gmskimg inimage gprgid instrument rafield decfield pa
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage
Image to be transformed (if MEF, specify extension).
.le
.ls gprgid
Gemini program ID.
.le
.ls instrument [gmos-n|gmos-s|flamingos2]
Gemini Instrument the input image is to be transformed into. The coordinate
transformations are different for each instrument. Lower-case values are
valid.
.le
.ls rafield
Right ascension of field centre required for the multi-object spectroscopy 
observations.  In hours or degrees, see parameter \fIfraunits\fR.
.le
.ls decfield
Declination of field centre required for the multi-object spectroscopy 
observations.  In degrees.
.le
.ls pa
Position angle required for the multi-object spectroscopy observations. This is
the same angle as used to define the observations in the Observing Tool.
.le
.ls fraunits = "hours" [hours|degrees]
Units for \fIrafield\fR.
.le
.ls outimage = ""
Name of output pseudo-Gemini image.  
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
Toggle interactive mode for GEOMAP.  GEOMAP finds the transformation 
coefficients used to produce pseudo-GMOS image.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile.  If empty, the default value is taken from 
\fImostools.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls fl_debug = no
Print debugging information.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error.  This
parameter is always set by the task, ans should not be modified by the user.

DESCRIPTION
.sp
GMSKIMG is called by GMSKCREATE, and should not be used as a standalone task. 
GMSKIMG creates a pseudo-Gemini image for use in GMMPS. 
.sp
The transformation from input image to pseudo-Gemini image is found by 
generating a grid of x-y coordinates based on the RA and Dec of the field 
center and the transformation specified by \fIinstrument\fR. These x-y 
coordinates are mapped to the x-y of the input image calculated from the WCS 
information in the input image header.
.sp
The required WCS header keywords are CRPIX1, CRPIX2, CRVAL1, CRVAL2, CD1_1, 
CD1_2, CD2_1 and CD2_2. The above procedure assumes that the WCS given by 
these keywords and the astrometry of the objects in the \fIindata\fR file 
correspond reasonably well. If this is not the case then the slits plotted by 
GMMPS will not lie on top of the objects in the pseudo-Gemini image.  This is 
not a problem for the mask creation, but may make it more difficult to design 
the best mask. 
.sp
The RA and Dec grid are a set of nested 3x3 object grids with the indicated 
field center as the center of each grid. The grids are of a size chosen to 
evenly cover the entire field of view for the \fIinstrument\fR indicated in 
the parameters.  The RA grid coordinates are corrected using a cos(DEC) 
correction to create a grid projected on to the instrument field of view which 
is square. The RA and Dec object grid is transformed to \fIinstrument\fR x,y 
positions using the transformations in GMSKXY.
