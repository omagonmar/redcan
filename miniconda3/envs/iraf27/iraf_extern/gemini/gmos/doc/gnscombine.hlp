NAME
gnscombine - Combine Nod-and-Shuffle GMOS data frames into a master frame
.ih
USAGE
gnscombine inimages offsets outimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
List of input images to process. 
These images will be sky subtracted, shifted, and combined to create
the output frame. Input images must first be pre-processed
using the GPREPARE task (to embed necessary header information)
before running them through GNSCOMBINE. This is the only
step needed before running this task to produce a final
cosmic-ray-rejected data frame. (However, if you want to work with
bias frame subtracted data, these input images should first be 
bias subtracted using GSREDUCE).  The input images can have
been processed with GMOSAIC, however this not recommended (see Note 1 in 
DESCRIPTION). Input can given as a list of images. Wildcards are 
supported. The image names may include the directory path. The 
images must be in multi-extension FITS (MEF) format.
.le
.ls offsets
Text file with x,y offsets. Each row in the file should
give the x and y offsets for a single frame. The x and y
offsets should be separated by a space character. There
should be one offset for each input frame, specified
in the same order as the input frames are
specified to the task.
.le
.ls outimage
Output sky-subtracted, registered, and combined MEF image.
.le
.ls outcheckim = ""
An optional output image produced without cosmic-ray rejection.
Inspection of this frame can be a useful diagnostic to ensure
that stacking is occurring reliably and cosmic-ray rejection is
working correctly.
.le
.ls outmedsky = ""
An optional data frame created as an intermediate
step by GNSCOMBINE. This is the median sky frame as computed
by the algorithm described below. This is useful for subsequent
noise estimates.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
Name of the MEF extension containing the science data.
.le
.ls var_ext = "VAR"
Name of the MEF extensions containing the variance frame.
.le
.ls dq_ext = "DQ"
Name of the MEF extensions containing the data quality array.
.le
.ls mdf_ext = "MDF"
Name of the MEF extension containing the Mask Definition File.
.le
.ls fl_vardq = no
Create or propagate the variance and data quality images?
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by gmos.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION

GNSCOMBINE is a high-level script that attempts to create a combined,
cosmic-ray rejected master sky-subtracted frame from gprepared, 
nod & shuffled GMOS spectroscopy frames.  Frames need to be
be grepared before being run through this script.  See the
documentation for GNSSKYSUB for information on how nod & shuffle sky
subtraction works.

It is easy to make a master combined frame by simply running GNSSKYSUB
on each input frame data, shifting each frame to line it up to a
common system, and then calling GEMCOMBINE to stack all the
frames. This works OK, but in practise this is slightly non-optimal
because the correct weights to use with GEMCOMBINE depend on sky
values, and the sky has already been removed.  So GNSCOMBINE tries to
be a little more clever (and very close to optimal) by adopting the
following procedure:

0. Shift the input frames by a (user-specified) offset in x and y using 
imshift.

1. Compute a median sky frame using GEMCOMBINE.

2. Sky subtract each shifted input frame using GNSSKYSUB.

3. Add the median sky frame back to each shifted, sky-subtracted frame 
so GEMCOMBINE will be able to combine these with the correct weights.

4. Combine frames from previous step using GEMCOMBINE and cosmic ray
rejection using the 'ccdclip' algorithm.

5. Subtract the median sky frame from the combined frame.

Notes:

1. gnscombine should not be run on frames which have been processed with
GMOSAIC because this can introduce rotations and the sky is assumed to be in
the same column as the object. Rather any mosaicking should come later.

2. Currently gnscombine gives all frames equal weights in the combination.
So they should all have the same exposure setting, grating setting & 
cloud+seeing conditions.

EXAMPLES

1. Sky subtract and stack a list of images:

TIME REQUIREMENTS
An unloaded 800Mhz Athlon PC (640Mb of RAM)
running Redhat 7.1 Linux 
takes about 7 minutes to create
a master frame from 5 gprepared GMOS
frames.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
Improvements to the (previously semi-functional) variance and
data quality propagation in the GMOS package have undergone limited
testing; the accuracy of the results should still be verified at
each step by the scientist, particularly for spectroscopic data
reduction tasks.
