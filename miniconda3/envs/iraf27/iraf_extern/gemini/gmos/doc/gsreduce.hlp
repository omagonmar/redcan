NAME
gsreduce -- Reduce spectra from GMOS (overscan, trim, bias, dark, mosaic, flat,
approximate wavelength calibration, cut MOS data)

.ih
USAGE
gsreduce inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
Input GMOS spectroscopic images.  Lists and wild cards are supported.
Images can be either raw or already processed with GPREPARE.  
All images must be in multi-extension FITS (MEF) format.  
This task is only meant for use with longslit or MOS spectroscopic data, 
not IFU or imaging data.
Directory names should not be included as part of the image names.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
List of reduced MEF images, if not using \fIoutpref\fR to define the output 
names.  The output images can be specified as a list file or a comma separated 
list of images.  \fIoutimages\fR has precedence over \fIoutpref\fR. 
.le
.ls outpref = "gs"
Prefix for output images.  Names of output images will be the name of the 
input images with the prefix \fIoutpref\fR attached.  \fIoutpref\fR is used 
only if \fIoutimages\fR = "". 
.le
.ls fl_over = yes
Apply overscan correction by fitting and subtracting the overscan 
level. If "yes", the parameter \fIkey_biassec\fR is used to 
query the overscan section parameters from the header. 
.le
.ls fl_trim = yes 
Trim the image.  If \fIfl_trim\fR=yes, the image is trimmed to keep only the 
image sections defined by the parameter \fIkey_datasec\fR.
.le
.ls fl_bias = yes
Subtract the bias image.  If \fIfl_bias\fR=yes, the bias image must be 
specified by the \fIbias\fR parameter.
.le
.ls fl_gscrrej = no
Clean the images for cosmic ray hits using GSCRREJ (original method for GMOS
spectra)? GSCRREJ is run interactively if \fIfl_inter\fR=yes. Other parameters
for GSCRREJ need to be set using the parameter file for GSCRREJ before running
GSREDUCE. With the possible exception of bright targets, better results are
likely to be achieved using \fIfl_crspec\fR instead.
.le
.ls fl_crspec = no
Clean the images for cosmic ray hits using GEMCRSPEC (newer method, wrapping LA
Cosmic)? This requires the user to have installed LACOS_SPEC separately; see
GEMCRSPEC help.
.le
.ls fl_dark = no 
Subtract the scaled dark image.  If \fIfl_dark\fR=yes, the dark image must 
be specified by the \fIdark\fR parameter.
.le
.ls fl_qecorr = no
Quantum efficiency (QE) correct your input data? If "yes" and the input data is
spectroscopic, a wavelength reference image (\fIqe_refim\fR) or QE correction
image (\fIqe_corrimages\fR) must be supplied. For imaging data no reference or 
correction images are required. Images must have been or about to be BIAS or
DARK subtracted for them to be QE corrected. For more detailed information 
please read the gmos example for your given observation mode (type 
'gmosexamples' at the IRAF or PyRAF prompt).
.le
.ls fl_flat = yes 
Apply flatfield correction.  If \fIfl_flat\fR=yes, the spectral flatfield 
image must be specified by the \fIflatim\fR parameter. 
.le
.ls fl_gmosaic = yes
If \fIfl_flat\fR=yes, the input images will be mosaiced using GMOSAIC.
If \fIfl_flat\fR=no and \fIfl_mosaic\fR=yes, the images will also be mosaiced.
If \fIfl_flat\fR=no and \fIfl_mosaic\fR=no, the images will not be mosaiced.
.le
.ls fl_fixpix = yes
Interpolate across the detector gaps (defined by \fIbpmfile\fR) when merging 
the separate science extensions into one extension with GMOSAIC.
.le
.ls fl_gsappwave = yes
Run gsappwave on the reduced output images to provide an initial wavelength 
calibration based on the grating and central wavelength.
.le
.ls fl_scatsub = no
Model and subtract scattered light background, using GSSCATSUB? At present,
this option is only suitable for long-slit science data; correction of flat
field and MOS exposures is unsupported. This option is still considered
experimental.
.le
.ls fl_cut = yes
For MOS data, cut the science extension into multiple separate extensions with 
one slitlet per extension.  Requires \fIfl_gmosaic\fR=yes.
.le
.ls fl_title = yes
For MOS data, put the object ID in the title of each separate extension.  
Requires \fIfl_cut\fR=yes.
.le
.ls fl_oversize = yes
Scale the slit lengths by 1.05x when cutting (GSCUT)? The default is likely
to be changed to "no" in a future release.
.le
.ls fl_vardq = no
Create and propagate the data quality and variance extensions. 
.le
.ls fl_fulldq = no
Passed to GMOSAIC, if data are not mosaiced already. Setting
\fIfl_fulldq\fR=yes will decompose the \fIdq_ext\fR extensions into their
constituent bits before transforming them. The pixels in the individually 
transformed bit planes are then checked against the multiple of \fIdqthresh\fR
times the bit value. Pixel values in the individual bit planes greater than
this value are then set to the current bit value, less than this value the
pixel values are set to 0, i.e., good. Once this is done for all bit values in
the original \fIdq_ext\fR extension, the newly transformed and thresholded bit
planes are combined by a bitwiseOR to form the output \fIdq_ext\fR
extension. This is only done for CCDs 1 and 3. In addition, pixels that are
created during the transformation, i.e, output pixels that lie outside of the
dimensions of the input plane are flagged with a bit value of 16. It is
recommended to set \fIfl_fulldq\fR=yes as this will retain \fIdq_ext\fR
information correctly.
.le
.ls dqthresh = 0.1 (min=0.01, max=0.5)
Fractional threshold to apply and flag pixels as contaminated with the current
bit value when decomposing \fIdq_ext\fR extensions (\fIfl_fulldq\fR=yes).
.le
.ls bias = ""
Bias calibration image to be subtracted if \fIfl_bias\fR=yes.  
This image must be in MEF format with the same number of extensions as the 
\fIinimages\fR. It must also match \fIinimages\fR  in the binning, readout 
mode and detector section read out. The bias calibration image \fIbias\fR 
should be created using the GBIAS task. 
.le
.ls dark = ""
Dark image to be scaled and subtracted if \fIfl_dark\fR=yes.
This image must be in MEF format with the same number of extensions as
 the \fIinimages\fR.  
It must also match \fIinimages\fR  in the binning, readout mode and detector 
section read out.  If \fIfl_vardq\fR=yes, \fIdark\fR should 
also contain variance and data quality extensions.  The dark correction image 
\fIdark\fR should be created using the GNSDARK task.  The \fIkey_exptime\fR 
parameter must be set correctly for proper exposure scaling of the \fIdark\fR. 
The dark current for GMOS is very low (< 1 e-/hour) and the subtraction
of a dark image in generally not needed.
.le
.ls flatim = ""
The normalized flatfield spectral calibration image to be used if
\fIfl_flat\fR=yes. The spectral flatfield image \fIflatim\fR
must be generated with the GSFLAT task. The format of \fIflatim\fR is a MEF
image with either one or three science extensions and possible variance and 
data quality planes (if \fIfl_vardq\fR=yes). This format may differ from the 
format of the \fIinimages\fR, \fIbias\fR and \fIdark\fR images, if 
\fIflatim\fR has been processed with GMOSAIC.If \fIfl_vardq\fR=yes, 
\fIflatim\fR should also contain variance and data quality extensions. 
.le
.ls geointer = "linear" (linear|nearest|poly3|poly5|spline3|sinc)
Specifies the interpolation scheme used by the IMMATCH.GEOTRAN which is
called by GMOSAIC. See the GEOTRAN help for more information. Use "nearest"
to avoid any data smoothing. 
.le
.ls gradimage = ""
Gradient image to use for identifying slit edges. This should normally 
be a GCAL flat field taken with the same configuration as the images that 
are being reduced. It is recommended to use the output \fIcombflat\fR 
from GSFLAT.
.le
.ls refimage = ""
Reference image whose MDF contains information about the location of the 
slits.  If both \fIgradimage\fR and \fIrefimage\fR are defined, 
\fIrefimage\fR takes precedence. It is recommended to use the output 
\fIcombflat\fR from GSFLAT.
.le
.ls qe_refim = ""
Wavelength reference image used as a template to create the QE correction image,
for spectroscopic data only. This file must have an associated wavelength
database solution (from gswavelength); as such, it will also have been
mosaicked by GMOSAIC and, if applicable, GSCUT or GFEXTRACTed. For more
detailed information please read the gmos example for your given observation
mode. This parameter accepts a list of files. However, if a list is supplied
there must be one reference image for each input image. In either case the
reference image must have been observed with the same observing set up as the
corresponding input image(s).
.le
.ls fl_keep_qeim = yes
Keep the image that is created to QE correct the input data? Spectroscopy only.
.le
.ls qe_corrpref = "qecorr"
Prefix added to \fIqe_refim\fR to name the output QE correction image.
.le
.ls qe_corrimages = ""
Either output name for the QE correction image when creating the QE correction
image for the first time, or a previously created QE correction image to be 
used to QE correct the input data instead of creating one from 
scratch. This parameter accepts a list. If using this parameter to supply
the output name for a new created QE correction image, the list must contain 
the same number of entries as \fIqe_refim\fR. Or if supplying the names of 
previously created QE correction images, the number of supplied names must be 
the same as the number of input images or just one that will be applied to all.
Previously created QE correction images must have the same observing set up 
as the input images.

times as bright as the underlying flux (estimated from the surrounding
pixels) are flagged and rejected.
.le

Maximum number of detection and cleaning iterations for each input image
extension (GEMCRSPEC).

which contains MDFs for longslit spectroscopy.
.le
.ls bpm = ""
Bad pixel mask used to create the data quality extension if requested 
(\fIfl_vardq\fR=yes).  \fIbpm\fR should be created using the GBPM task. 
.le
.ls gaindb = "default"
Database file containing the GMOS gain data. The default value for \fIgaindb\fR

Database file containing the GMOS filters data. 
.le
.ls xoffset = INDEF
The offset in the X (wavelength) direction between the theoretically

important if \fIfl_detec\fR=yes when creating the normalized flat frame with
gsflat. If \fIwave_limit\fR is set to INDEF, the red end of the spectrum is cut
using a value of either the upper wavelength limit of the grating, the upper
wavelength limit of the filter band-pass, the 2% quantum efficiency cut-off of
the detector in the red (which is typically 1025 nm and 1050 nm for the EEV and
e2vDD CCDs, respectively) or the edge of the detector, whichever has the
shortest wavelength. The user can use \fIwave_limit\fR to override this default
behaviour. However, if the edge of the detector occurs before the value
supplied for \fIwave_limit\fR, the spectrum will end at the edge of the
detector. The same value must be used for both the gsflat and gsreduce
\fIwave_limit\fR parameters. The one exception is when the science data are not
cut, e.g., for longslit data. In this instance, if the user requires
information in the science data beyond the default wavelength range determined
automatically by gscut, the gsflat \fIwave_limit\fR parameter should be
increased. See the gscut help file for more information.

used when \fIfl_over\fR=yes. The overscan regions of GMOS CCDs have some
photon bleeding from the science frame. \fInbiascontam\fR is the number of
columns next to the data section that are not used when calculating the
overscan to subtract.
.le
.ls biasrows = "default"

DESCRIPTION

.le
GSREDUCE is used for basic reductions of GMOS longslit and MOS
spectroscopic images.  
At a maximum, 200 images can be reduced at once. If the number of input 
images is larger than 200, the task will exit with an error message. 

The input images must be multi-extension FITS (MEF)
files, and can be either raw images or previously processed with
GPREPARE.  If raw images are input then GPREPARE will be automatically
called.  

If bias subtracting and \fIfl_vardq\fR=yes, GIREDUCE will create variance and 
data quality extensions. Please refer to the help pages for GIREDUCE for 
more information.

The reduction steps are defined by the flags \fIfl_over\fR,
\fIfl_trim\fR, \fIfl_bias\fR, \fIfl_gscrrej\fR, \fIfl_dark\fR, \fIfl_flat\fR,
\fIfl_gmosaic\fR, \fIfl_fixpix\fR, \fIfl_gsappwave\fR, \fIfl_cut\fR,
and \fIfl_title\fR.  

The calibration images for bias subtraction and dark subtraction are 
identical to those used for direct imaging observations, and should be 
created using the GBIAS and GDARK. GDARK is not yet available.

Cleaning for cosmic ray hits is done if \fIfl_gscrrej\fR=yes.
GSREDUCE calls GSCRREJ for this step.

The normalized spectral flatfield calibration
image may have a different format from either the input data or the
other calibration images (\fIbias\fR or \fIdark\fR) and must be
generated using the task GSFLAT.  To use a spectral flatfield produced
in any other way one must add the GSFLAT keyword to the header of the
flatfield before GSREDUCE will proceed.  
GSREDUCE is capable of using GSFLAT produced flatfield images with
either one or three science extensions (\fIgsflat.fl_detec\fR=no or yes, 
respectively).

GSREDUCE is essentially a wrapper around GIREDUCE for the overscan
subtraction and trimming, bias subtraction, and dark subtraction.  
If the input flatfield has three science extensions, then GIREDUCE is
also called to multiply the three CCDs by the gains, and to apply the
flatfield.  The image may then be cleaned for cosmic ray hits using GSCRREJ. If
the input flatfield has only one science extension (i.e. it has been 
gmosaiced), then
images from the 3 CCDs are here multiplied with the gains (using the
hidden task GGAIN), processed with GMOSAIC to produce an image
with one science extension, and then divided by the flatfield.  One 
also has the option of interpolating across the gaps in the detector array 
(with \fIfl_fixpix\fR=yes) when GMOSAIC is run.  
MOS observations are then cut into separate spectra for
each slitlet using GSCUT. The slits are identified using GSCUT.  The
grating and filter databases, \fIgratingdb\fR and
\fIfilterdb\fR, and the offsets \fIxoffset\fR, \fIyoffset\fR and
\fIyadd\fR must
be the same as used by GSFLAT when the flats were created.  The object
ID for each slitlet can optionally be written into the title for the
corresponding science extension.  The next step allows for a rough
wavelength calibration to be applied based on the GMOS grating and
central wavelength using GSAPPWAVE (\fIfl_gsappwave\fR=yes).

With the default parameters for GSREDUCE, the output is a MEF, 
with the mask definition file (MDF) included as a FITS binary table.
MOS data will have one science extension for each object in the MDF.
The counts in output images will be in units of electrons per pixel, since
the data were multiplied with the gains.  
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Reduce a list of longslit images, constructing the output image names by 
attaching a prefix "gs" to the input image names.  The raw input images are
stored in another directory.  Bias correct the input images but do not 
perform dark correction.  Trim the image but do not subtract the overscan 
region.  Do not create/propagate variance and data quality extensions.  Flat 
field the images but do not interpolate across the detector gaps in the 
science data. Apply a rough wavelength calibration based on the GMOS grating 
and central wavelength parameters stored in the header.  Save the logfile into 
the file "reduce.log" which has been defined as the system logfile 
(gmos.logfile).

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
There is no checking to ensure that the offset parameters used for 
GSREDUCE were the same parameters used by GSFLAT to produce the flatfield.

Improvements to the (previously semi-functional) variance and
data quality propagation in the GMOS package have undergone limited
testing; the accuracy of the results should still be verified at
each step by the scientist, particularly for spectroscopic data
reduction tasks.
