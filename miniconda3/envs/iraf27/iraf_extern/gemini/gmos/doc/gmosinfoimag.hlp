DESCRIPTION

The GMOS package contains tasks for processing GMOS imaging, 
long-slit, multi-object, and integral field spectroscopy data. 
The specifics of the individual tasks can 
be found in their help files. This document describes the common 
features of the imaging tasks.

The tasks are designed to provide a fairly complete and flexible
reduction for the purpose of assessing data quality at the time
of observation.  Real-time reductions may not be optimal for a 
particular science application.  The GMOS package scripts can be
optimized for a particular application using the hidden parameters to
achieve the best possible results.

The tasks produce logfiles of the performed processing steps.
The name of the logfile may be set in each individual task, or at
the package level by setting \fIgmos.logfile\fR.

The tasks add header keywords to the output images. These header
keywords contain information about the performed processing steps
and the values of the critical parameters that were used.

All GMOS images are written as multi-extension FITS (MEF) files.
Raw data can have up to six unnamed extensions.  
Most of the header information is written to the primary header unit [0] 
(PHU).  After being processed with GPREPARE, GMOS data extensions will be 
named as described in GMOSINFO.  

It is recommended to use \fIimtype\fR="fits". This is set automatically
when loading the GEMINI package.

SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE IMAGING TASKS
.ls GIFLAT - Derive imaging flat field.
GIFLAT is used for deriving normalized flat fields for the GMOS 
imaging data. The input images are
calibration unit (GCAL) flat fields, twilight flats, or dome flats.
The output images are the normalized flat field.  
If the input files are raw, GIFLAT calls GPREPARE to update the
headers and GIREDUCE to trim input images, subtract the overscan 
level, subtract the bias image and create variance and data quality 
frames. The images are also multiplied with the gains.
GIFLAT uses GEMTOOLS.GEMCOMBINE to combine the flat fields. 
.le
.ls GIREDUCE - Reduce GMOS imaging data 
GIREDUCE is used to trim, subtract overscan level, subtract bias image,
and subtract (scaled) dark image,
and flat field correct the science data.  
Any subset of these reductions may be chosen by setting the flags
of the task accordingly.
After processing with GIREDUCE the images have
been multiplied with the gains and the count levels in the output images 
are in units of electrons.
GIREDUCE creates variance and data quality planes if requested. Variance
frames based on Poisson statistics are only created if bias subtracting.
.le
.ls GIFRINGE - Derive fringe frame for GMOS images
GIFRINGE is used to create fringe frames for GMOS imaging data.
Fringing is significant for i' and z' imaging from both GMOS-N and
GMOS-S. GIFRINGE may also be used to create scattered light frames.
.le
.ls GIRMFRINGE - Subtract fringe frame from GMOS images
GIRMFRINGE is used to subtract off a fringe frame created by
GIFRINGE. Scaling of thee fringe frame is possible.
.le
.ls GMOSAIC - Mosaic the 3 GMOS CCDs into one image
GMOSAIC will create MEF file with a single pixel extension that 
contains the a mosaic of the 3 CCDs. GMOSAIC correctly accounts 
for the gaps between the CCDs.
.ih
TYPICAL REDUCTIONS
For typical reductions the user will need appropriate bias, 
dark, and flat field images, and the science image.
A fringe frame (or scattered light frame) may be created
from the science data or from observations of a blank field.

1. Use GPREPARE to update the raw data headers for the 
reductions.  The other tasks will
call GPREPARE as needed if the data has not been GPREPAREd.

2. Use GBIAS to create a bias image.
It is recommended to use \fIfl_over\fR=yes and subtract the overscan level.

3. Use GIFLAT to derive normalized flat fields.
For twilight flats, the parameters may need adjusting to correctly
clean the images for signal from stars.

4. Use GIREDUCE to trim the images, subtract the overscan level, 
subtract the bias image,
subtract the scaled dark image and divide by the flat field.
The dark current for GMOS is low enough that 
subtraction of the dark image is normally not needed, i.e.,
it is recommended to use \fIfl_dark\fR=no.

5. If needed use GIFRINGE to create a fringe frame, or scattered
light frame. Use GIRMFRINGE to subtract the fringe frame from
the science data.

6. Use GMOSAIC to create a mosaic of the 3 GMOS CCDs into one image.

WHAT TO DO NEXT
The processed images may be co-added with the task GEMTOOLS.IMCOADD.
Photometry may be derived with any suitable photometry package.
Images processed to the point of mosaicing with GMOSAIC may be used
for mask designs using the GMOS Mask Making Software. Dithered observations
may be co-added with GEMTOOLS.IMCOADD and then used for mask design.
Further information about the GMOS Mask Making is available at

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The tasks in the GMOS package have been tested with three and 
six extension MEF files. 

The tasks in the GMOS package are designed to operate on MEF FITS
images that have been processed using GPREPARE.  GPREPARE will not
run on data from instruments other than GMOS.  The GMOS tasks will
not run on simple FITS files.

Input image names should in general not contain directory paths as not
all tasks have been tested in this mode.

Improvements to the (previously semi-functional) variance and
data quality propagation in the GMOS package have undergone limited
testing; the accuracy of the results should still be verified at
each step by the scientist, particularly for spectroscopic data
reduction tasks.
