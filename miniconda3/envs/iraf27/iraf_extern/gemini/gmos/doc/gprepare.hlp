NAME
gprepare - Prepare raw GMOS data for reductions
.ih
USAGE
gprepare inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
List of raw GMOS images to prepare.  Can be a list of images.
Wild cards are supported. The image names may include the directory
path. The images must be in multi-extension FITS (MEF) format.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
Path for the directory where the raw GMOS images are located.  One may 
set this parameter if the raw data are not located in the current 
working directory, or specify a path in the input image file names.
If \fIrawpath\fR != "" (ie. not an empty string) it will be combined 
with any path given as part of the input image names.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
Output MEF images. The parameter can be one single image name, 
a list of images or a list file; as long as the number of output images matches
the number of input images. \fIoutimages\fR has precedence over
\fIoutpref\fR.
.le
.ls outpref = "g"
Prefix for output images. Names of output images will be the names of 
the input images with the prefix attached. \fIoutpref\fR is used 
if \fIoutimages\fR="". If \fIoutpref\fR is used and does not contain 
a directory path, the prepared images are written in the current directory.
\fIoutpref\fR may contain a directory path, in which case this defines
where the prepared images are written relative to the current directory.
.le
.ls fl_addmdf = no
Attach the Mask Definition File (MDF) to the output images. 
If \fIfl_addmdf\fR=yes, the task will 
look for the FITS table given either by the keyword \fIkey_mdf\fR or by 
the input parameter \fImdffile\fR, and check if it is a valid MDF. The 
task will not attach an MDF to data taken in imaging mode. 
Spectroscopic data should be processed with \fIfl_addmdf\fR=yes.
If \fIfl_addmdf\fR=no no MDF will be attached and the output image will
be a copy of the input image with the appropriate header modifications.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
Name of the MEF extension containing the science data.
.le
.ls key_mdf = "MASKNAME"
Header keyword containing the name of the MDF associated with 
the input image. \fIkey_mdf\fR has precedence over \fImdffile\fR (except
for older IFU data, where the header name does not specify the MDF
uniquely).
.le
.ls mdffile = ""
Name of the MDF to attach if \fIfl_addmdf\fR="yes" and the 
keyword \fIkey_mdf\fR is not found (or is simply "IFU") in the image
header. If \fIinimages\fR is a list of images, the same MDF will be
attached  to all of them.
.le
.ls mdfdir = "gmos$data/"
Directory containing MDFs. The default value points to the directory
which contains MDFs for longslit spectroscopy.
.le
.ls gaindb = "default"
Database file containing the GMOS gain data. The default value for \fIgaindb\fR
is gmos$data/gmosamps.dat.
.le
.ls key_ron = "RDNOISE"
Header keyword for the read noise in electrons.
.le
.ls key_gain = "GAIN"
Header keyword for the gain in electrons/ADU.
.le
.ls ron = 3.5
Default read noise in electrons to use if the \fIgaindb\fR is not available 
and the header keyword is not found.
.le
.ls gain = 2.2
Default gain in electrons/ADU to use if the \fIgaindb\fR is not available and 
the header keyword is not found.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by gmos.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION

GPREPARE is used prepare raw GMOS images for reductions.
GPREPARE can be used to attach the Mask Definition File (MDF) to 
GMOS spectra. Input must be multi-extension FITS (MEF) files 
containing the science pixel extensions only, or the 
science pixel extensions plus the MDF (in any order). 
If the output names are not given, a prefix (given by \fIoutpref\fR) 
will be prepended to the input image names.
If \fIoutpref\fR is used to define the output images and does not contain
a directory path, the output images 
are written in the current directory, independent of where the 
input images are located.  If \fIoutpref\fR contains a directory path,
then this defines where the images are written relative the current directory.
The output image names are constructed by removing the directory path 
from the input image names an prepending the \fIoutpref\fR.

The MDF is attached if \fIfl_addmdf\fR=yes. Spectroscopic data should
be processed with \fIfl_addmdf\fR=yes. The task will look for 
the name of the file containing the MDF first from the image PHU under 
the keyword defined by \fIkey_mdf\fR. 
If \fIkey_mdf\fR is not defined or does not exist in the header (or if
its value is simply "IFU" rather than "IFU-2", "IFU-R" etc.), it will 
try the file defined as \fImdffile\fR. In this latter case, the task will 
set \fIkey_mdf\fR=MASKNAME and write it to the PHU of the output image, 
containing the name of the file. If both \fIkey_mdf\fR and \fImdffile\fR 
are blank, or if the designated file does not exist, the task will exit 
with an error.

The task will first check the current directory for the requested MDF, and
then check the directory defined by \fImdfdir\fR.
The task will only attach MDFs to data taken in spectroscopic mode.

If \fIgaindb\fR is available, the read noise and gain are read from this 
file, and the values in the header are updated using the keywords given 
by \fIkey_ron\fR and \fIkey_gain\fR. The task GGAIN is called for 
these header updates.
If \fIgaindb\fR is not available the read noise and gain are 
read from the header keywords \fIkey_ron\fR and \fIkey_gain\fR. If these 
header keywords are not in the headers, the read noise and gain are 
defined by the parameters \fIron\fR and \fIgain\fR.

If \fIfl_addmdf\fR is set to "no", no MDF will be attached and 
the output image will be a copy of the input image with the appropriate 
header modifications. 

The following header keywords are created or updated:

In the PHU (Primary Header Unit):
.in 5

OBSMODE : IMAGE, MOS or IFU. Identifies the observing mode, from the 
MASKTYP keyword

NSCIEXT : The number of SCI extensions

NEXTEND : The total number of extensions

GPREPARE: Time stamp for execution of the task
 
GGAIN   : Time stamp for update of read noise and gain using the task GGAIN

GEM-TLM : Time stamp for last modification with a task from the GEMINI package
.in -5


In the extension headers
.in 5

EXTNAME: name of the extension (SCI)

EXTVER : extension version (1 to 3 or 1 to 6 for each science extension)

RDNOISE: Updated with values from \fIgaindb\fR if available

GAIN   : Updated with values from \fIgaindb\fR if available

DISPAXIS : Set to 1 for spectroscopy data
.in -5

EXAMPLES

1. Prepare a single image, output to the current directory but getting
the raw data from another directory.  

.nj
   cl> gprepare inimage rawpath="/d1/rawdata/2001aug04/" 
.ju

2. Prepare a list of images

.nj
   cl> gprepare @inlist outimages=@outlist 
.ju

3. Prepare a list of spectra, allowing for use of the prefix and 
adding the MDF given if not found in the header.

.nj
   cl> gprepare @inlist outimages="" fl_addmdf+ key_mdf=MASKNAME \
       mdffile=gmosmask_0001.fits
.ju

4. Same as (3) but overriding header information

.nj
   cl> gprepare @inlist outimages="" fl_addmdf+ key_mdf="" \
       mdffile=gmosmask_0001.fits
.ju   

5. Prepare images from different directories, using the prefix to
define the output image names. The output images are written in the
current directory.

.nj
   cl> gprepare 2001dec24/N20011223S100,2001dec22/N20011221S100 \
       outpref=g rawpath=/d1/gmosdata/
.ju

6. Prepare images from different directories using wild cards to define the
input images, and using the prefix to
define the output image names. The output images are written in the
current directory.

.nj
   cl> gprepare 2001dec24/N20011223S10*,2001dec22/N20011221S10* \
       outpref=g rawpath=/d1/gmosdata/
