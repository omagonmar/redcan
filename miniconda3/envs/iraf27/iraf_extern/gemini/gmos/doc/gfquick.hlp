NAME
gfquick -- Quick reconstruction of GMOS IFU images of acquisition
.ih
USAGE
gfquick image 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Image to reconstructed.
.le
.ls rawdir = "adata$"
Directory containing raw data. The default is used during
GMOS observations at Gemini-North.
.le
.ls xpos1 = "default"
Approximate x-position for slit 1 on chip 1. This can be derived by
first displaying the image of chip 1. The "default" value corresponds to 1183
for GMOS-N and 1181 for GMOS-S. Both values are relative to the DATASEC of 
CCD 1. A call to GTILE is made to return the data in their respective CCDs with
the BIASSEC(s) removed. Hence, the xpos1 values being relative to the DATASEC
of CCD1.
.le
.ls nslit = "default"
Number of IFU slits being used. It is read from the MASKNAME keyword in the 
header. If there is no header keyword then it assumes 2,
.le
.ls fl_off = yes
Calculate instrument offsets from the reconstructed image? (Useful for
acquisition purposes).
.le
.ls ioff = 1
If calculating instrument offsets from the reconstructed image, 
which of the two output images should be used?
\fIioff\fR=1 uses the main field, \fIioff\fR=2 uses the background field.
.le
.ls fl_spos = yes
Re-determine the y-shifts of the output fibre positions? 
This may be needed after instrument hardware changes. If "no" then values must 
be added.
.le
.ls yoffu = "default"
If not redetermining the y-shift then use this value for the shift.  The 
"default" value is 12.
.le
.ls issport = "side" (up|side)
Telescope ISS port. Defines on which telescope port GMOS is mounted.
This information is needed when deriving instrument offsets 
(\fIfl_off\fR=yes) for centering the target.

.le
DESCRIPTION

GFQUICK does a quick-and-dirty reconstruction of GMOS IFU data into
an image.  The task is primarily used for acquisition purposes.
It is released as part of the Gemini IRAF package in order to make
it possible for the users to reconstruct the acquisition images
taken through the IFU. 
Reconstruction of GMOS IFU data for science use should be done
by processing the observations with GFREDUCE, followed reconstruction
using GFDISPLAY and/or GFCUBE. The full reduction is described in
GMOSINFOIFU.

The input image must be a full-frame read out in 3-amp mode, and can
either be an undispersed image taken through the IFU,
or a dispersed image taken with the IFU and a grating. In the latter
case, a strong continuum is needed in order to be able to see the
object in the reconstructed image.

In both cases GFQUICK works on raw data, which it looks for in the
directory \fIrawdir\fR. It extracts the appropriate image sections
corresponding to blocks of IFU slits and rearranges them in the format
of an image.  The task does a crude bias subtraction by subtracting
off a fixed constant depending on whether the image was taken in fast
or slow readout mode.

Since the images of the IFU fibres can appear at slightly different
positions on the GMOS image, the X-position of the image of the IFU slit
can be specified by the user, as the parameter
\fIxpos1\fR. The value to enter here can be determined before running
gfquick by displaying an undispersed image taken through the
IFU. \fIxpos1\fR should be the X-position at which the slit appears on
chip 1 (extension 1). The X-position of the slit will generally 
stay constant unless the GMOS gratings (or mirror) have been re-indexed.
The default values correspond to 1210 for GMOS-N and 1181 for GMOS-S.

The position of the fibres can also vary in the Y-direction. For
example different gratings will have a different shift relative to the
mirror. GFQUICK has an option to re-determine the shift to use 
(\fIfl_spos\fR=yes) - this
is best done using an undispersed image through the IFU (for the
mirror case) or a dispersed flatfield frame (for a grating).  In
general these shifts should then stay constant unless the GMOS
gratings/mirror are removed and replaced for any reason. Therefore the
Y-shift for a particular grating (or mirror) will normally stay
constant from night to night during an observing run. The default values 
correspond to 12.

If the shift for a particular grating/mirror is already known,
it can be set using the parameter \fIyoffu\fR and the flag to 
redetermine the shift, \fIfl_spos\fR=no can be used.

If the shift is not known then it can be determined using gfquick with
\fIfl_spos\fR=yes. In that case the parameter \fIyoffu\fR is ignored
and the user is asked to click on the image of a particular fiber to
determine the shift. This shift is written to the screen for future
use. In this case, if it is impossible to determine the shift visually one
can always revert to the default value (see on screen instructions).

GFQUICK produces two output images, one for the primary IFU field and
one for the background field. The size of the output images depends on
whether one or two IFU slits are being used. The parameter \fInslit\fR
is read from the MASKNAME keyword on the header. If the image has no MASKNAME 
parameter, then it should be set corresponding to the hardware setup of the IFU
when the data were taken. The output images are named after the input image
names with the strings "_ifu1" (main field) and "ifu2" (background
field) appended.

The pixel scale of the reconstructed images is 0.035 arcsec/pixel.
The orientation of the images is the same as for the imaging field.
The sizes of the images are as follows:

.nf
IFU1 in 2-slit mode: 6.93arcsec x 5.0arcsec
IFU1 in 1-slit mode: 3.47arcsec x 5.0arcsec
IFU2 in 2-slit mode: 3.47arcsec x 5.0arcsec
IFU2 in 1-slit mode: 1.73arcsec x 5.0arcsec
.fi

GFQUICK has the option to use the output reconstructed images to
calculate instrument offsets. This can be useful when setting up a
target on the centre of the IFU field. If \fIfl_off\fR=yes then the
task will display the output image requested (set using the parameter
\fIioff\fR) and will ask the user to click on the part of the image to
be centred, then press q. The task then calculates the instrument
offsets required to centre the object in the field.  
The information about the telescope ISS port, \fIissport\fR, is needed
for these offsets to be correct.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The current version of GFQUICK works only on full-frame images.
It is intended as a tool for acquisition purposes and not for
quantitative science use. In particular, flux is not conserved from
the raw image to the reconstructed version.
