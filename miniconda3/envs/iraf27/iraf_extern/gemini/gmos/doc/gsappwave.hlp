.ih
USAGE   
gsappwave inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
Input files of reduced GMOS spectra from GSREDUCE.
This may be a list or include wildcards.
Directory names should not be included as part of the image names.
.le
.ls gratingdb = "gmos$data/GMOSgratings.dat"
Database file with GMOS grating information.
.le
.ls filterdb = "gmos$data/GMOSfilters.dat"
Database file with GMOS filter information.
.le
.ls key_dispaxis = "DISPAXIS"
Header keyword for dispersion axis
.le
.ls dispaxis=1
Dispersion axis, if not defined from the header.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by gmos.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION 

GSAPPWAVE calculates a simple wavelength calibration based on the
grating, filter (if any), and central wavelength.  The calibration
will be best near the center of chip 2 and degrade towards the corners
as the distortion in the spectrograph is not accounted for yet.  It is
expected that the spectra have been processed by GSREDUCE.
GSREDUCE calls GSAPPWAVE as the final step in the reduction.

For MOS data, GSREDUCE calls GSCUT and then GSAPPWAVE. Correct calibration
of all the image extensions in the input MEF relies on GSCUT being run
first. If the user wants to change one of the databases and rerun GSAPPWAVE
to recalibrate MOS data, it is necessary to rerun GSREDUCE and its call to
GSCUT.

The gratings database \fIgratingdb\fR contains estimated offsets for the 
wavelength calibration for the GMOS gratings. If the user needs to adjust
those offsets, it is necessary to make a local copy of the default database, 
"gmos$data/GMOSgratings.dat", edit as needed, and then run GSAPPWAVE using 
this local copy.

GSAPPWAVE adds or changes the following header keywords
to each of the pixel extensions:

.nf
Keyword   Description
----------------------------------------------------------
WAT0_001  WCS description
WAT1_001  WCS description
WAT2_001  WCS description
CTYPE1    WCS type in X-axis (LINEAR)
CTYPE2    WCS type in Y-axis (LINEAR)
CRVAL1    Central wavelength in Angstrom
CRPIX1    Reference pixel in X-axis
CRPIX2    Reference pixel in Y-axis
CD1_1     WCS matrix element, dispersion in Angstrom/pixel
CD2_2     WCS matrix element (1.0)
CD1_2     WCS matrix element (0.0)
CD2_1     WCS matrix element (0.0)
DISPAXIS  Dispersion axis (1)

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
MOS data already processed with GSREDUCE and GSCUT cannot easily be recalibrated
with GSAPPWAVE, since for MOS data GSAPPWAVE relies on the keyword REFPIX1 added 
by GSCUT.
