NAME
gsdrawslits - Draw slits from MDF on a GMOS image
.ih
USAGE
gsdrawslits image mdf
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
GMOS image on which to draw the slits. The image is first displayed
if \fIfl_disp\fR=yes. The image must be in multi-extension FITS (MEF) format.
.le
.ls mdf    
Mask-definition-file (MDF) matching the GMOS \fIimage\fR.
.le
.ls fl_disp = yes
Display image before drawing the slits. If \fIfl_disp\fR = yes,
the image is displayed with the default stretch from DISPLAY in the 
frame defined by \fIframe\fR. If a stretch other than the default
is needed, the user can display the image first, and then use \fIfl_disp\fR=no.
.le
.ls fl_slits = yes
Draw the slits on the frame defined by \fIframe\fR.
Tilted slits are not drawn tilted.
.le
.ls fl_label = no
Label slits with the number from the ID column in the \fImdf\fR.
.le
.ls fl_spec = no
Draw the location of the spectra on the frame defined by \fIframe\fR.
.le
.ls lwidth = 4
Line width of slits and spectra. Because this task uses a simple interface
to TVMARK, the actual line width is smaller than \fIlwidth\fR.
\fIlwidth\fR = 4 is usually sufficient to see the slits even when the 
display is zoomed out to see the full GMOS field of view.
.le
.ls frame = 1
Display frame to use.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "1"
The name of the science extension to display. For raw data, especially 
acquisition images, then this should be an extension number such as "1". For 
reduced data this can be an extension name, eg. "sci,1".
.le
.ls drawprior = "all"
Priorities of objects for which to draw the slits and/or spectra, given 
as a comma separated list. If \fIdrawprior\fR = "all" slits and/or spectra are
drawn for all objects.
.le

DESCRIPTION

GSDRAWSLITS draws the slits defined in a mask-definition-file (MDF) on
a displayed GMOS image. The task is supplied as a convenient utility
task for visualizing MDFs without having to start the mask making software
(gmmps).

If \fIfl_disp\fR = yes, GSDRAWSLITS first displays the input image.
Then the task draws the slits (if \fIfl_slits\fR = yes) and then
the location of the spectra (if \fIfl_spec\fR = yes). The slits and
location of the spectra are color coded according to priority in the
MDF:

.nf
red    prior 1
green  prior 2
blue   prior 3
yellow prior 0
.fi

Tilted slits are not supported, i.e., tilted slits are not drawn tilted.

EXAMPLES

1. Display a GMOS image and draw the slits, the data are located in the current
directory.

.nf
   cl> gsdrawslits mrgN20011224S145_add GN2001B-Q-10-5.fits
.fi

2. Display a GMOS image and draw the slits, the image and the MDF are not in
the same directory.

.nf
   cl> gsdrawslits coadds/mrgN20011224S145_add mdfs/GN2001B-Q-10-5.fits
.fi

3. Display an image logarithmically with a custom stretch, then draw the slits
and the location of the spectra on the displayed image

.nf
   cl> display raw$mrgN20020214S066_add[1] 3 z1=650 z2=6000 zsc- zra- ztr=log
   cl> gsdrawslits raw$mrgN20020214S066_add raw$GN2002A-Q-89-2.fits frame=3 \
       fl_disp- fl_spec+
.fi

4. Same as (3) but draw only for priority 1 and 2 objects

.nf
   cl> display raw$mrgN20020214S066_add[1] 3 z1=650 z2=6000 zsc- zra- ztr=log
   cl> gsdrawslits raw$mrgN20020214S066_add raw$GN2002A-Q-89-2.fits frame=3 \
       fl_disp- fl_spec+ drawprior="1,2"
.fi
