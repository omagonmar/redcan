DESCRIPTION
The gain values for the GMOS instruments can change following work on the
detectors and their amplifiers.  The gain values used by the data reduction
software are stored in the files gmos$data/gmosamps*.dat.  Which file should be
used for a given is determined by the date at which the observation was
obtained.  The observation date is found in the header keyword DATE-OBS found 
in the Primary Header Unit (PHU) of a GMOS MEF file.
