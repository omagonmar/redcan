GEMINI (October2013)       Gemini IRAF package v1.12       GEMINI (October2013)

Release date: October 11, 2013

This document describes the revisions relative to the Gemini IRAF package
v1.11.1.

All users are encouraged to use Ureka (http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/) to install
IRAF and the Gemini IRAF package. Installation instructions for Ureka users can
be found at http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/processing-software/download.

Users who do not wish to use Ureka can download the Gemini IRAF package v1.12
for use with IRAF v2.14 (gemini_v112_for_iraf_2.14.tar.gz) or for use with the
32-bit version of IRAF v2.15 (gemini_v112_for_iraf_2.15.tar.gz). Please refer to
http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/processing-software/requirements 
for other requirements on your IRAF installation including other required
external packages. 

The Gemini IRAF package v1.12 will run under both IRAF and PyRAF environments.
Please note that PyRAF users using IRAF v2.15 will need to use a minimum of
PyRAF v1.11.

WARNING!! The Gemini IRAF package v1.12 does NOT work reliably with the 64-bit
version of IRAF v2.15.

WARNING!! The Gemini IRAF package v1.12 does NOT work reliably with the 32-bit
or 64-bit version of IRAF v2.16 as distributed by NOAO.

If updating an older installation of the Gemini IRAF package, it is recommended
that users initialize their uparm directories by typing "rm uparm/*" in their
iraf home directory (i.e., where mkiraf was executed / where the login.cl file
is located). NOTE: if you wish to make a note of any stored parameters, please
do so before running this command.

The binaries distributed with the package were built on Red Hat 9 and 
Mac OS X 10.6 Intel. See gemini_readme.txt for more information.

6) GMOS: a) Added more realistic gain values for GMOS e2vDD fast read low gain
            and fast read high gain modes

         b) Added ROI support to gdisplay and gmosaic

         c) Improved data quality propagation in gmosaic

7) NIRI: a) Updated the look-up table to include improved values

DETAILS OF THE REVISIONS
========================

A multitude of minor bug fixes are included in this release. They will not be
listed here. Rather, only the most notable changes or those more likely to be
of interest to the user will be highlighted.

1) GSAOI
------------------
Instrument: GSAOI

    a) Data reduction support for GSAOI is provided in this version of the
       Gemini IRAF package.

       Examples of how to reduce GSAOI data can be obtained by running the task
       gsaoiexamples.

2) F2
------------------
Instrument: FLAMINGOS-2

    a) Data reduction support for FLAMINGOS-2 is provided in this version of
       the Gemini IRAF package.

       Examples of how to reduce FLAMINGOS-2 data can be obtained by running
       the task f2examples.

3) GNIRS
------------------
Instruments: GNIRS

    a) The look-up tables in the gnirs$data directory were updated to include
       configurations required for GNIRS data taken with the new camera lens
       i.e., data taken since November 2012. The configurations for GNIRS data
       taken prior to this date remain unchanged.

4) GEMINI
------------------
Instruments: All

    a) The gmisc.ldisplay task was added to the gemtools package. The Gemini
       IRAF package v1.12 is no longer dependent on the external package gmisc.

    b) Relicensed SLALIB files were added to the Gemini IRAF package v1.12.

5) GEMTOOLS
------------------
Instruments: All

    a) The gemcombine task now accepts MEF BPMs. The bpmfile should be used to
       specify the name of the MEF BPM file. This change was made to support
       GSAOI.

6) GMOS
------------------
Instruments: GMOS North

    a) More realistic gain values for data taken in fast read low gain and fast
       read high gain modes using the new GMOS North e2vDD CCDs have been
       included in the look-up table.

    b) Region Of Interest (ROI) support has been added to gdisplay and gmosaic.

    c) Data quality propagation has been improved in gmosaic. The individual
       bit information is now correctly retained in the output files from
       gmosaic if the new fl_fulldq parameter is set to yes.

7) NIRI
------------------
Instruments: NIRI

    a) A number of improvements were made to NIRI specific values in the
       look-up table used to determine the wavelength solution.

SUMMARY OF ALL CHANGED PARAMETERS
=================================

If a task listed below is causing problems, it is very likely that the task is
accessing an old parameter file that does not contain the updated parameters
and/or values. To resolve the problem, the old parameter files for the Gemini
IRAF package must be removed from the uparm directory. To do this, initialise
the uparm directory by typing "rm uparm/*" in your iraf home directory (i.e.,
where you ran mkiraf / where your login.cl file is located). NOTE: if you wish
to make a note of any stored parameters, please do so before running this
command. If it is not desirable to remove all the old parameter files for the
Gemini IRAF tasks, it is possible to "unlearn" the individual task.

Please see the appropriate help file for more information about the specific
parameter changes listed below.
