NAME
qfastsky -- Derive sky image for QUIRC, median or min/max filtering
.ih
USAGE
qfastsky inimages outimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages 
Images to combine. \fIinimages\fR can be a comma-separated
list of image names or defined by using the * wild card.  QSKY also
accepts @filename to point to a file containing the names of the
input images.
.le
.ls outimage
Output sky image.
.le
.ls outtitle = "default"
The outtitle string will be written in the output image header 
under the keyword specified by i_title (see help page for
HEDIT).  If set to "default", QSKY will write
"SKY IMAGE from gemini.quirc.qfastsky" in the output image header.
.le
.ls key_exptime = "EXPTIME"
Header keyword for the exposure time.
.le
.ls combtype = "default"   [default,median,average]
Type of combine operation.
.le
.ls rejtype = "minmax"     [minmax,none]
Type of rejection.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of logfile. If empty, then the package logfile (\fIquirc.logfile\fR) is used.
If neither is defined, then \fIlogfile\fR=quirc.log is used.
.le
.ls nlow = 0
Number of low pixels to reject, when using \fIrejtype\fR=minmax.
.le
.ls nhigh = 1
Number of high pixels to reject, when using \fIrejtype\fR=minmax.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status
This flag is non-zero after execution of QFASTSKY if a fatal error was
encountered.

DESCRIPTION
.le
QFASTSKY makes a sky image from a list of input images.
QFASTSKY is designed to do a fast (but not necessarily) optimal
job of combining sky images and rejecting the pixels affected by
signal from objects.

With \fIcombtype\fR="default" the type of combination and rejection 
is chosen based on the number of input images. 
Two to four images are combined by averaging after rejecting the
highest pixel.  Five to seven images are median combined after
rejecting the highest and lowest pixels.  Eight and more images
are median combined rejecting the two highest and one lowest pixels.

QFASTSKY warns the user if the exposure times of the input images 
differ by more than 0.1 sec.

\fIcombtype\fR, \fIrejtype\fR, \fInlow\fR and \fInhigh\fR can also
be set by the user. However, the choices are limited since the
purpose of this task is to provide a fast determination of 
a sky image. For more advanced determinations, use QSKY.

EXAMPLES

1. To combine a list of images to a sky image

.nf
      cl> qfastsky image1,image2,image3,image4,image5 skyimage
.fi

2. To combine a list of images given in the file inputfile to a 
sky image

.nf
      cl> qfastsky @inputfile skyimage
.fi

3. To combine all fits images starting with "q" in the current directory
to a sky image

.nf
      cl> qfastsky q*fits skyimage
.fi
