GEMINI (Sep2002)         Gemini IRAF package v1.4       GEMINI (Sep2002)

Release date: September 20, 2002

This document describes the revisions relative to the Gemini IRAF package v1.3


PRIMARY REVISIONS:

1) Tasks for reduction of GMOS IFU data are now included in the "gmos" 
   package.
2) A cosmic ray rejection task is included for GMOS spectra.
3) Tasks for reduction of NIRI longslit spectroscopic data are now included
   in the "niri" package.
4) New tasks have been added to the "oscir" package, which now serves as the
   prototype of the reduction software to be developed for T-ReCS and other 
   mid-IR imagers.


DETAILS OF THE REVISIONS:

gmos
  All tasks in the "gmos" package should be unlearned prior to use in order
  to implement new parameters and default parameter values.

gmos.gbias
gmos.ggain (hidden task)
gmos.gireduce
gmos.gprepare
gmos.gstransform
gmos.gswavelength
  Small bug fixes and better stability.

gmos.gdisplay
  Transparent handling of images with only one extension.

gmos.gmosaic
   User defined interpolation type.

gmos.garith
   The task has been retired and replaced with the generic MEF arithmetic task
   gemtools.gemarith

gmos.gscut
  Distortion in the X-direction taken into account. 
  Easier user defined X- and Y-offsets
  Small bug fixes and better stability.

gmos.gsextract
  Support for sky subtraction as part of the extraction.

gmos.gsflat
  Support for the user defined X- and Y-offsets in gscut.
  
gmos.gsreduce
  User defined interpolation type. Optional call to gscrrej.

gmos.gnsskysub 
  New task for sky subtraction of Nod-and-Shuffle data taken with GMOS.

gmos.gscrrej
gmos.gscrmask
  New tasks for cosmic ray cleaning of GMOS spectroscopic data.

gmos.gfapsum
gmos.gfcube
gmos.gfdisplay
gmos.gfextract
gmos.gfquick
gmos.gfreduce
gmos.gfresponse
gmos.gfskysub
gmos.gftransform
  New tasks for reduction of GMOS IFU data. A description of the typical IFU
  reductions is included as the task "gmosinfoifu".
  Example reductions of IFU data are included in "gmosexamples".

gmos.mostools.stsdas2objt
  Small bug fixes. Support for Flamingos-I.


niri
  All tasks in the "niri" package should be unlearned prior to use in order
  to implement new parameters and default parameter values.


niri.nprepare
  Handling of regions-of-interests added.

niri.niflat
  Write BPM as a separate file.

niri.nireduce
niri.nifastsky
niri.nisky
  Smaller bug fixes and optimizing.

niri.nsappwave
niri.nsextract
niri.nsflat
niri.nsreduce
niri.nssdist
niri.nstransform
niri.nswavelength
  New tasks for reduction of NIRI spectroscopic data. See also "niriinfo".
  An example reduction has been included in "niriexamples".


oscir.obackground
oscir.oflat
oscir.ohead
oscir.oreduce
oscir.oview
  The "oscir" package have been extended to serve as a proto-type for the
  reduction software for T-ReCS and other mid-IR imagers.


gemtools.imcoadd
  Support for use of the header WCS for defining the transformations.
  Support for use of instrument offsets in the image headers for defining
  the transformations. Automatic selection of bad pixel file. Smaller bug fixes.

gemtools.gemarith
  New task. Generic arithmetic task for MEF files. Replaces gmos.garith.

gemtools.gemoffsetlist
  New task for splitting images lists based on offsets in space or time. Used
  extensively by the tasks in the "niri" package.

gemtools.gemlogname (hidden task)
gemtools.gemvsample (hidden task)
  Generic tasks for support of various parameter checking have been added to 
  the "gemtools" package.
