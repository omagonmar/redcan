NAME
.nf
nirotate -- Rotate NIRI images based on WCS information in the
            headers, rather than by identifying objects.  This
            is most useful for Altair data taken with the cass
            rotator fixed.

USAGE
nirotate inimages

PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
NIRI images that need to be de-rotated based in WCS information
in the headers.  Images should have been NPREPAREd first.  This 
string can be an image name, a list of image names, a wild-card
file name, or the "@" syntax can be used to direct the task to read
a list of file names. 
.le 
.ls outimages = ""
The output, rotated image names.  If this field is left blank the
\fIoutprefix\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must
match the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.
The allowed syntax for this field is the same as for \fIinimages\fR.
The output images must not exist already; an error condition occurs
if they do.
.le
.ls outprefix = "rot"
Prefix for output images.  This field is used if \fIoutimages\fR is
empty.  The names of output images are the names of the input images 
with this prefix attached.
.le 
.ls interpolant = "linear"
Interpolation algorithm used by the ROTATE task.  The allowed
algorithm are: nearest, linear, poly3, poly5, spline3, sinc,
lsinc, drizzle.  See the help page for ROTATE for complete 
description of each algorithm.
.le
.ls fl_vardq = yes
Propagate the variance and data quality planes.  Note that the 
variance and data quality planes must be present in all the
input images.  If they are not and \fIfl_vardq\fR is set to 'yes',
\fIfl_vardq\fR will be re-set to 'no' and a warning will be issued.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile.  If left empty, the task will use the logfile
name defined by niri.logfile, or "niri.log" if the latter is also
not defined. 
.le
.ls glogpars = ""  (pset)
The name of the text file containing the Gemini logging preferences
parameters.  The parameters relating to the entry levels to be
written are found here.  If \fIglogpars\fR is undefined then the default
parameters set in the uparm directory are used.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
Name of the MEF extension containing the science data.
.le
.ls var_ext = "VAR"
Name of the MEF extension containing the variance frame.
.le
.ls dq_ext = "DQ"
Name of the MEF extension containing the data quality frame.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an 
error.  This parameter is always set by the task, and should
not be modified by the user.

DESCRIPTION
.le
NIROTATE uses the WCS information to "blindly" de-rotate
NIRI images.  This is most useful for NIRI/Altair AO data
taken with the cass rotator fixed, in which there may not
be two objects to determine the rotations directly.
NIROTATE uses the regular IRAF task SKYMAP to determine
the angles, and ROTATE to perform the transformation.
