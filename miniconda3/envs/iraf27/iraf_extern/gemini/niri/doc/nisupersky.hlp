NAME
nisupersky -- Use coadded image to create deeper object masks for NISKY
.ih
USAGE
nisupersky inimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage 
Combined (imcoadded) image for object identification.  Input 
image must be a MEF file with one science extension and a valid
WCS in the PHU.  The coadded image must also contain the list of
individual frames that went into making it listed in the header
as IMAGENN where the NN correspond to sequential numbers.
All the input images must be on a common WCS coordinate system.
.le
.ls threshold = 3.5
Threshold in sigma for object detection by OBJMASKS.  This 
parameter can be tuned to balance between finding faint objects and
triggering on spurious noise peaks.
.le
.ls ngrow = 3
Number of iterations used by OBJMASKS to extend identified objects 
to surrounding regions of lower surface brightness, to remove the wings.
.le
.ls agrow = 3.
This  parameter sets the maximum area objects can be extended into the 
wings by OBJMASKS.
.le
.ls minpix = 6
Number of contiguous pixels above \fIthreshold\fR required for
OBJMASKS to identify an object.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
Name or number of science extension.
.le
.ls dq_ext = "DQ"
Name or number of data quality extension.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Logfile of operations.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
This flag is non-zero after execution of NISUPERSKY if a fatal error was
encountered.

DESCRIPTION
.le
NISUPERSKY creates deep object masks for use with NISKY.
It begins by identifying objects using OBJMASKS 
in a combined image, usually
produced using IMCOADD.  NISUPERSKY retrieves the WCS 
coordinates and the names of the files used to create it.
These are taken from the header of the combined image, and
must be in the form IMAGENN where the NN corresponds to
sequential digits starting at 01.

NISUPERSKY then extracts the portion of the mask created
using the combined image that overlaps with each individual
input image.  These are combined with the existing NISKY
mask files, if they exist, or with the DQ plane of the
individual images, if they exist.  NISUPERSKY writes mask
files that NISKY can then use to create a better sky
image, with objects masked that would otherwise be too faint to
detect in the individual images.

The order of steps would normally be:
.le
1. NISKY to create the initial sky frame.  
.le
2. NIREDUCE to sky subtract and flatten individual images.
.le
3. IMCOADD to combine the individual images.
.le
4. NISUPERSKY to create deeper sky masks.
.le
5. NISKY to create the final sky frame (delete sky frame
first).
.le
6. NIREDUCE using the new sky frame (delete reduced files
first).
.le
7. IMCOADD to create the final stacked image (delete combined
files first).
