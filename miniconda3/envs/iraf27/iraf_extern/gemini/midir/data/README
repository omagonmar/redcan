Files in midir/data:

(in main directory)

michelle.badpixels  --  bad pixel mask file for Michelle (a bit out of date)
trecs.badpixels     --  bad pixel mask file for T-ReCS (a bit out of date)
standards.list      --  list of all Cohen mid-infrared standard stars, 
                        and the associated spectral energy distribution 
                        files used by mstelluric; a small number of 
                        other standards from other sources are included 
                        as well
asteroid.dat        --  this is a spectral energy distribution file for 
                        a "generic" asteroid; it is based on the ISO 
                        observations of Ceres.  A blackbody fit to those 
                        data was scaled so that it is for radius 100 km 
                        and distance 1.00 AU (so it assuming the same 
                        emissivity, albedo, etc as Ceres)

The sub-directories allsky, bright, primary, sirtf and timmi2 hold the 
spectral energy distribution files.  These are the standard format 
IRAF SED files which can be used with the noao.onedspec.calibrate 
routine as well as mstelluric.  The objects are split into different 
sub-directories for "historical" reasons, as these reflect different 
papers in the Cohen et al. "Spectral Irradiance Calibration In The Infrared"
series.  Value for stars in the different sets have different levels of
accuracy.

(in sub-directory michelle)

Here there are a set of files for use with mistdflux, the estimated flux
density values (in Jy or mJy) for a large group of standard stars

allaltatmos.list -- actual values at 1.0 airmasses assuming a 
                    particular set of atmospheric conditions
allatmos.list    -- values as extrapolated to zero airmass
                    assuming a particular set of atmospheric conditions
all.list         -- values as predicted to apply outside the atmosphere
zeromag.tem.flux -- zero magnitude flux densities for all the Michele
                    filters

(in sub-directory trecs)

Here there are a set of files for use with mistdflux, the estimated flux
density values (in Jy or mJy) for a large group of standard stars

allaltatmos.list -- actual values at 1.0 airmasses assuming a 
                    particular set of atmospheric conditions
allatmos.list    -- values as extrapolated to zero airmass
                    assuming a particular set of atmospheric conditions
all.list         -- values as predicted to apply outside the atmosphere
zeromag.tem.flux -- zero magnitude flux densities for all the T-ReCS
                    filters

For both T-ReCS and Michelle these are the same standard stars that have 
spectral energy distribution values in the various sub-directories of 
midir/data.
