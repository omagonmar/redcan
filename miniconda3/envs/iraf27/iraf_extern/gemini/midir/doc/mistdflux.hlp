NAME
mistdflux -- Find the in-band flux density of a mid-IR standard 
star for either Michelle or T-ReCS
.ih
USAGE
mistdflux stdname filters
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls stdname
The name, or partial name, of a Cohen or TIMMI2 mid-infrared standard star. 
The task will either find the first match to this string in the list of 
standards or, if \fIfl_matchall\fR is "yes" it will find all matches to this 
string in the list of standards.  The names use underscores in some cases 
such as "alpha_Cen_A" for alpha Cen A.  Most of the names are the HD numbers 
such as "HD169916".  The match is not case-sensitive.
.le
.ls filters
A list of names or partial names for the filters to match.  If this is set to 
"all" (case-insensitive) then all filter flux densities will be printed 
out.
.le
.ls fl_matchall = no
A boolean value which determines whether all matches to the standard name will 
be printed or just the first one.
.le
.ls atmos = "none"  [none|normalized|extinction]
Set whether the task prints the in-band flux density based on the outside the 
atmosphere spectrum ("none"), with a model for atmospheric absorption but 
corrected to zero airmass ("normalized"), or with a model for atmospheric 
extinction and at 1.0 airmasses ("extinction").
.le
.ls instrument = "trecs"    [trecs|michelle]
Indicates which instrument is being used.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile.  The default value makes the task use the logfile defined
by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print actions to the screen.  If \fIverbose\fR is 'no', only the results will
be printed to screen.  All info will still be written to log though.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error, or if
an important warning was issued.  This parameter is always set by the task,
and should not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task is used to obtain the filter flux density in Jansky for any of the 
mid-infrared standards as estimated to be observed in the T-ReCS or Michelle 
filters. These F_nu estimates are calculated by integrating the spectrum of 
the standard over the filter profile, but WITHOUT the additional effects of 
the mirrors, the aperture window, and any wavelength-dependent detector 
response effects included.  In addition, the default is to not calculate 
the effect of any atmospheric absorption on the values.  One can 
change this with the \fIatmos\fR parameter, but there are only two cases 
of atmospheric absorption that one can specify and these are somewhat limited 
as is discussed below.
.sp
The large majority of the standards are identified by their HD number, but 
the brighter ones are identified by names such as "mu UMa", "alpha CMa", and 
so on converted to lower case and with underscores instead of spaces since the 
names are read in as in C free format and thus would otherwise end at 
the first space.  For the very faint stars defined as SITRF standards by 
Martin Cohen some lack an HD number.  See the original series of papers by 
Martin Cohen for lists of these objects.
.sp
The general process is to calculate
.sp
.nf
total in-band flux = int(star_photon_flux_density * filter_response) /
                     int(filter_response) 
.fi
.sp
(where "int" denotes integration over wavelength across the filter)
using the stellar flux density defined by Martin Cohen converted from F_lambda 
to photon flux (i.e. by dividing by h * nu or equivalently multiplying by 
lambda and then dividing by c * h).  As defined above only the relative 
filter response matters, in that if the whole filter profile were 
multiplied by a constant factor then the resulting value will be exactly 
the same.  The in-band filter flux is then converted to F_nu in Jy for 
printing out.  This is done by assuming that the spectrum has a constant 
F_nu over the effective width of the filter defined by the 50% of peak values 
at long and short wavelengths.
.sp
Since the Cohen spectral values are defined outside the atmosphere, this 
gives the values without any atmosphere as they should be observed at 
airmass 0.0.
.sp
If one wants to have some idea of the effect of the atmosphere, one can 
change the \fIatmos\fR parameter from "none" to "normalized" or "extinction". 
If one chooses "normalized" then the filter profile in the above schematic 
equation is replaced by an atmospheric transmission function times the filter 
response in both the numerator and denominator integrations.  The atmospheric 
transmission model is for airmass 1.0, calculated separately for Cerro Pachon 
and for Mauna Kea because the altitudes are different.  In both cases the 
water column was assumed to be 2 PMM at zenith.  This is somewhat dry for 
Cerro Pachon, while it is about average for Mauna Kea according to the long 
term monitoring of the water column at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.
.sp
Since the value is normalized by the filter and atmospheric responses, the 
value that is returned in this case is roughly what one will get from 
an extrapolation of the star brightness to zero airmass, and it changes only 
a bit from the \fIatmos\fR = "none" case.  This gives some idea of the
uncertainties in the zero airmass value due to saturated lines in the 
filter passband, but is a very crude estimate.
.sp
As an alternative, one can specify \fIatmos\fR = "extinction" in which case 
the atmospheric effects are applied only in the integration over the stellar 
spectrum, not to the denominator integral.  This shows the effects of the 
atmospheric absorption at airmass 1.0 compared to the outside the atmosphere 
conditions.
.sp
One can ask for a specific filter names, or partial names, or use "all" to get 
all filter values.  If a list of filter names or partial filter names is 
specified the task goes through the list of filters and returns all matches 
found.  Thus filter="N" matches the " N (broad 10um)" filter, the 
"[NeII] 12.81um" filter, and the "[NeII]cont13.10um" filter for T-ReCS.  If 
one specified "Si" one would get all six of the medium band "silicate" filters 
and the "[SIV] 10.52um" as the match is not case-sensitive.
.sp
For the name of the object the task will either find the first match to the 
name or partial name, if \fIfl_matchall\fR is "no", or find all matches to 
name or partial name , if \fIfl_matchall\fR is "yes".  Be warned that using
"HD" with \fIfl_matchall\fR set to yes returns more than 500 entries.
.sp
The \fIinstrument\fR parameter can be set to either "michelle" or "trecs".  
Separate calculations have been done for the filters for each instrument 
because they differ somewhat even when the filter is the same.

.sp
Note the duplicate values for several of the objects, as they are listed 
in more than one set of standards.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The number of decimal places in the values is a bit excessive given that the 
typical global uncertainties in the Cohen spectral files are 2%.
.sp
It would be better to have a variety of airmasses and water vapour contents 
for Cerro Pachon or Mauna Kea in the models, but time limitations in 
generating so many sets of values does not allow this.
.sp
The atmospheric transmission models calculated by the ATRAN program may 
not accurately model the real atmospheric transmission accurately in all 
cases, although the errors when dealing with these filters are expected to 
be small.
.sp
The atmospheric transmission model is not applied to the K, L, and M filters 
for T-ReCS. It applies only to the N-window and Q-window filters for both 
instruments.  The near-infrared filters are not normally used with T-ReCS.
.sp
A few of the bright standards are in several lists (TIMMI2 and Cohen 
primary standards) and thus are in the file more than once.
