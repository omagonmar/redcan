NAME
miptrans -- Carry out a calculation of the Stokes parameters from a 
stacked Michelle polarimetry file
.ih
USAGE
miptrans inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task. It can be an image name, 
a list of image names, a wild-card image name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
files that have been made by the MIPSTACK task.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output image name(s) for the transformed files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "p"
A prefix string which is prefixed to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The path to the directory containing the Michelle image files.  
If the value is "" (empty string) the current directory is used.
.le
.ls fl_register = no
A boolean variable that flags whether the four input images at the four 
waveplate positions should be registered (using the XREGISTER task 
in the images.immatch package) before the transformation is done.  If the 
value is "yes" then the \fIregions\fR parameter must be set to whichever 
part of the images contains a bright source.  If the entire image is used
for registration the results may be poor.  Generally it is best to define a 
small box around a bright object when doing registration.
.sp
Note that registering the images at the different waveplate positions 
may not be a good thing to do.  If the different component images are 
distinctly different due to the object having a strong polarization the 
registration may be wrong and the resulting polarization images will 
therefore also be wrong.
.le
.ls regions = "[*,*]"
This parameter specifies an image section to be used for registration of the 
individual wave-plate images before the calculation of the Stokes parameters 
is done, if the \fIregister\fR parameter is set to "yes".
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Set this for logging to the screen as well as the log file.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION
.sp
This task takes the four Michelle polarimetry mode images and uses the standard
equations to calculate the Stokes parameters for linear polarization, I, U and 
Q.
.sp
There is an option to register the images with the XREGISTER routine 
before carrying out the transformation.  This is recommended if there is a 
relatively bright object in the field.  If this is done, a box needs to be 
defined around the object, with something like 10 pixels space on all sides. 
The image section to use for registration is defined in the \fIregions\fR 
parameter.  Generally using the entire image for registration does not produce 
the best results, especially because of the possible presence of the negative 
chop beam images on the detector when doing imaging polarimetry.  When the 
registration is requested the pixel offsets are printed to the terminal.  
These offsets should not be large.  Offsets that are significantly more than 
1 pixel in x or in y are probably not correct.
.sp
The formulae used for the transformation are as follows, where the four 
wave-plate images at 0, 22.5, 45, and 67.5 degrees are denoted by I00, I45, 
I90, and I135 respectively:
.sp 
U = I00 - I90
.sp
Q = I45 - I135
.sp
I = (I00 + I45 + I90 + I135)/2
.sp
The output image is a MEF file with three image extensions, each of dimension 
[320,240].  These are I, U, and Q, respectively.  The primary image header 
is taken from the input file.
