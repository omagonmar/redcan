NAME
mipstack -- Performs a straight average of the nod images within a given 
data file, for Michelle polarimetry mode.
.ih
USAGE
mipstack inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task. It can be an image name, 
a list of image names, a wild-card image name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
files that have been made by the TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output image name(s) for the registered files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "s"
A prefix string which is prefixed to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The path to the directory containing the T-ReCS or Michelle image files.  
If the value is "" (empty string) the current directory is used.
.le
.ls frametype = "dif"
A variable to mark which type of images are to be combined: the default is 
"dif" for the difference frames, but it can also be "src" for the on-source 
frames or "ref" for the sky reference frames.
.le
.ls combine = "average"
A variable which can have the values "average" or "sum".  This determines 
whether the combination of images is done via averaging or by summation. 
This variable is passed to the IMCOMBINE task as its \fIcombine\fR 
parameter.  Any value aside from "average" or "sum" produces an error.
.le
.ls fl_register = no
A flag for whether the individual waveplate images should be registered 
before being combined.  If the value is "yes" then all images at a given 
waveplate position for each individual NOD position are registered to the 
first image in the group.  Registration is done with the XREGISTER
task.  The \fIregions\fR parameter determines what part of the image is used 
in the registration process.  Normally registration using the whole image 
does not work well.
.le
.ls regions = "[*,*]"
When \fIfl_register\fR is "yes", this parameter determines the region(s) of 
the image that is used in the registration.  While the default is the 
entire image, this does not usually work well.  The region(s) should be 
selected to be around some bright and compact object(s) in the field, if 
at all possible.  This parameter is used by the IRAF task XREGISTER.
.le
.ls fl_stair = yes
This is a flag for whether or not to try to remove channel to channel offsets
in the stacked images.  This can only be done properly if the target does 
not occupy a large fraction of the detector.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by midir.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
.sp
This task is very similar to MISTACK, but is specialized for Michelle 
polarimetry observations.  See the help for MISTACK for a discussion of 
how the original images in the raw data file are combined to form a single 
stacked frame.  This routine does nothing to files taken in normal mode
rather than polarimetry mode.
.sp
What is different here is that the stacking of the individual images is done 
for each of the four positions of the waveplate in Michelle.  The output image 
therefore contains four extensions rather than one as in the case for 
non-polarimetric observations.  The four extensions are for wave plate 
positions of 0 degrees, 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 67.5 degrees 
respectively.  Each extension has five new FITS keywords:
.sp
.nf
    WPLATE   : The waveplate angle, in degrees;
    POLANGLE : The polarization selection angle, in degrees;
    ANGROT   : The polarization angle offset of the instrument, in degrees;
    T        : The waveplate transmission value;
    E        : The waveplate efficiency value.
.fi
.sp
The polarization selection angle is twice the waveplate angle, so it has 
values of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees.  This header value can be used as the 
\fIkeyword\fR parameter in the LINPOL routine (which is in the 
noao.nproto package) to calculate polarization maps.  The other keywords
are intended to allow the images to be analyzed with the "polpack" package,
which is part of the starlink software.
.sp
The \fIfl_stair\fR flag is analogous to that in the MIPSTACK task: 
if the value is "yes" then this task removes channel to channel offsets 
from the Stokes I, U, and Q images as these are created.  This is done 
by finding the medium pixel value for each of the sixteen channels in the 
detector.  These median values are subtracted off the image sections of 
the stacked Stokes images.  This will only work if the target object does 
not fill one or more of the channels.in the detector, which are vertical 
sections 20 pixels across.  The median levels in the various channels 
differ by a few ADU in a typical image.  This can have an effect on the 
polarization signature over the image if it is not removed.  One can run 
the task with and without the \fIfl_stair\fR option set and subtract the 
pairs of images that result to see what effect the staircase correction 
has.  This should be done if the object in the field is large.
.sp
Each extension is a single image of dimension [320,240].  The primary header 
is taken from the input image.
.sp
Once the stacked polarization file has been produced, the Stokes parameters 
can be generated using the MIPTRANS task.

EXAMPLE
.sp
1. Here is an example where registration is used.  There is a bright star 
in the field at position [207,159] so a21 by 21 box around this star 
is used for the registration.  In this particular case the different 
images need to be registered because of a drift over the observation 
due to the cassegrain rotator being fixed.
