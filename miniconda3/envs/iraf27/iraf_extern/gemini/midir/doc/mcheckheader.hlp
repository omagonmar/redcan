NAME
mcheckheader -- check the primary headers of Michelle raw data files and make 
some simple fixes of incomplete headers
.ih
USAGE
mcheckheader inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The list of input image(s) to be checked.  It can be an image name, a list 
of image names, a wild-card expression, or the name of a file listing the 
images prefixed by "@".  Note that these files will have their primary 
headers changed if they are found to lack a few specific keywords.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
An optional string giving the path to the images.  If it is blank they are 
assumed to be in the current directory.
.le
.ls update = yes
A flag for whether the headers should actually be updated or not.  If it is 
"no" then the changes are listed but not actually carried out.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by midir.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
A returned exit status value.  If there are no error it is set to zero, 
otherwise to some positive integer.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This simple script can repair the headers on certain Michelle raw data files 
so that they can be set to the Gemini Archive at the Canadian Astronomical 
Data Center (CADC).  The only data files that may need to have this done are 
those for observations that were aborted during execution.
.sp
The changes that this script will make to the primary header, extension zero 
of the assumed multi-extension FITS file, are rather limited and quite 
specific.  It does not attempt to repair all possible problems.  What it will 
do is to search for the ENDTIME header keyword.  If this is lacking then  
it will search for a STARTTIM header keyword.  If that is missing nothing 
more is done.  If it is found, a very crude estimate of the length of the 
observation is calculated from the total number of data extensions.  Each 
one of these is assumed to correspond to a single NOD position with a length 
of 45 seconds.  This time interval is added to the starting time to get some 
idea of the time when the observation finished.  Using this an ENDTIME value 
is inserted into the primary header (subject to the update flag).  The 
change to the header is done using the NHEDIT task.
.sp
The keywords OBSTIME, and OBSEND are also inserted into the header using the 
same start and end time values.
.sp
If missing the OBSCLASS keyword will be added to the primary header unit.  The
value will be set to "unknown".
.sp
Note that no check is made for whether raw images come from Michelle.  It 
makes no sense to try using this script on any other type of file.
.sp
One can get an idea of what changes need to be made without actually 
changing anything by setting the \fIupdate\fR flag to "no".  This flag 
sets the update flag in NHEDIT.
.sp
If a file has already been passed through this routine, nothing more will 
be done to the header the second time.

EXAMPLES
1. Check and fix a raw Michelle image located in directory "raw/".
