NAME
tcheckstructure -- Checks the structure of a T-ReCS file
.ih
USAGE
tcheckstructure image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The name of the image to be checked.  The task can only work on one image 
at a time.  One can specify the full path to an image.  This is in fact 
required for images in other directories, since one cannot specify a path
to the image.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls modeflag = 0
An output integer value that indicates the mode of the T-ReCS observation.  
In the case of raw T-ReCS files the value is set to 1 for CHOP-NOD 
observations, 2 for CHOP observations, 3 for NOD observations, 
and 4 for STARE mode observations.  If the file is not a T-ReCS file 
or the mode of observation cannot be determined, this value is set to 0.
.sp
In addition, if the file appears to be output from TPREPARE this 
value is increased by 10 (i.e. 11 for CHOP-NOD, 12 for CHOP, etc).
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION
This is a utility routine which examines the structure of a T-ReCS file.  
It is intended to insure that the file has the proper physical structure: 
the correct number of extensions, and the correct image dimensions in 
the extensions.
.sp
The task reads the primary header and attempts to determine how many image 
extensions the file should have based upon the values of keywords such as 
SAVESETS, NNODS, and NNODSETS.  It then counts the actual 
number of extensions and compares this to the expected value.  If they do not 
match, the task exits with an error message.
.sp
If the expected number of extensions is found, then the task looks at the 
image dimensions of all the extensions to make sure that they are correct 
for the mode of the observation.  It will flag any instances of "wrong" image 
dimensions.
.sp
Depending upon whether any problems are detected, the task sets the 
\fIstatus\fR value to either 1 (in case of errors) or 0 (in the case 
where the file seems to be correct).  It is this value and the \fImodeflag\fR 
value which other T-ReCS tasks look at after TCHECKSTRUCTURE has been 
called.
.ih
EXAMPLE
1. The way the task is used is:
.sp
.nf
    cl> tcheckstructure S2003B0909S0012 
.fi
.sp
One can then examine the exit status or the mode of the observation by 
querying \fItcheckstructure.status\fR and \fItcheckstructure.modeflag\fR.  
Entries are also written to the logfile, and to the terminal if the 
\fIverbose\fR flag is set.
