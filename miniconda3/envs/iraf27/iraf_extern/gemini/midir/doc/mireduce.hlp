NAME
mireduce -- Reduce images from MID-IR Instruments (Bad pix correction, 
combining, flat field)
.ih
USAGE
mireduce inimages 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task. It can be an image name, 
a list of image names, a wild-card image name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
either "raw" T-ReCS or Michelle files or names of files that have been 
made by the TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output image name(s) for the reduced files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.sp
These file names are for the final reduced images.  If various of the 
\fIfl_view\fR, \fIfl_mask\fR, etc. options are chosen, the task will 
also generate other output files in the processing.
.le
.ls outpref = "r"
A prefix string which is prefixed to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The path to the directory containing the T-ReCS or Michelle image files.  
If the value is "" (empty string) the current directory is used.
.le
.ls fl_background = no
A boolean value which determines whether the input images are sent to the 
TBACKGROUND task for processing.  This option is currently supported only
for T-ReCS data.
.le
.ls fl_view = no
A boolean value which determines whether the input images are sent to the
TVIEW, MVIEW, or MIVIEW tasks in the processing.
.le
.ls fl_mask = no
A boolean value which determines whether the input images have a bad pixel
mask applied to them.  The bad pixel mask to use is specified by the 
\fIbpm\fR parameter.  Such mask files will be produced by the MIBPM 
task (although that task does not currently exist in the package).
.le
.ls bpm = ""
The name of a bad pixel mask file.  If not specified, the package default
bad pixel mask file appropriate to the instrument is used.
.le
.ls fl_flat = no
A boolean value which determines whether the input images are flat-fielded 
using the file specified by the \fIflatfieldfile\fR parameter.  Such a 
flat field frame can be produced by the MIFLAT task.  If this value 
is "yes" then the flat field frame will be applied to all the individual 
frames of the input images.
.le
.ls flatfieldfile = ""
The name of a flat field file produced by the MIFLAT task.
.le
.ls stackoption = "stack"
A parameter for how the individual frames are to be combined.  The value 
can be either "stack" or "register".  In the former case the individual 
frames are combined by simple averaging/summing depending on the \fIcombine\fR
parameter value.  In the latter case the individual frames are shifted using 
the XREGISTER task so that any small shifts between frames are allowed 
for, and then combined.  One should only register the frames if there 
is a reasonably bright source in the field of view.  If the source is 
bright enough the entire image can be used for registration, but there is
an option to restrict the region so used by changing the \fIregion\fR 
parameter.
.sp
If a T-ReCS input file is "prepared" then the option to register the frames 
is also applied in that step.  One cannot currently stack the frames in 
TPREPARE and then register them in MIREGISTER in a single call to this task. 
One would have to run this task twice with different options to do this.  
The same is true for registering the frames in TPREPARE followed by 
stacking the resulting frames to produce the final image.  One would 
normally run TPREPARE separately if either of these was what one wanted to 
do.  No such considerations apply to Michelle files because they can be 
registered only when creating the final output image.
.sp
The choice of stacking or registering frames determines whether MISTACK
or MIREGISTER is used to combine the images.  This choice determines 
whether the flat fielding and bad pixel masking options (if requested) are 
carried out before the TPREPARE and MIREGISTER routines are 
run (registering option) or whether these options are carried out as the 
last steps in the processing (stacking option).
.le
.ls frametype = "dif"
This is a character string that can take the values "dif", "src" or "ref". 
It determines which image is combined by the MISTACK routine: the 
default is the difference images, for "dif"; one can also choose 
to combine the on-source images, for "src", or the reference images, for "ref".
These are respectively images "[*,*,3]", "[*,*,1]", and "[*,*,2]" in each 
extension of the prepared files produced by TPREPARE or MPREPARE. 
The default output prefixes are "r", "c", and "a" for these three options, 
which one gets if \fIoutpref\fR and \fIoutimages\fR are empty strings.  This 
option works only with \fIstackoption\fR = stack and so if \fIframetype\fR is 
something beside "dif" then the \fIstackoption\fR value is forced to "stack".
.le
.ls combine = "average"
This string parameter can take values of "average" or "sum".  It is passed 
to IMCOMBINE to determine whether the images are combined by averaging 
(with equal weights) or by summation.  The default is to average.
.le
.ls fl_display = no
A boolean value which determines whether the final output images are displayed 
on the stdimage display.
.le
.ls frame = 1
Display frame to be loaded.
.le
.ls fl_check = yes
A boolean value which determines whether the input image is checked during 
the processing.  This currently is implemented only for T-ReCS files.  If 
the value is "no" then various file structure checks are disabled and 
the task tries to process the file(s) even if they are incomplete.
.le
.ls fl_rescue = no
A boolean value which determines whether the MPREPARE task will 
attempt to process data files from observations that did not finish
normally.  This only applies to Michelle raw data files.
.le
.ls region = [*,*]
When \fIstackoption\fR is "register", and thus MIREGISTER is 
called, this region of the images is used for registration.  The 
default is to use the full image for registration.
.le
.ls fl_variance = no
A boolean flag passed to MISTACK or MIREGISTER which 
determines whether the variance image will be written out to the 
final output file.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION
This routine takes T-ReCS or Michelle image files (either the raw images,
or files created by the TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks) and carries 
out the standard pipeline reduction on them.  There are various boolean 
parameters which determine which of the pipeline tasks are applied to the 
images.  The output images are MEF files which have a single data extension 
within which is a [320,240] reduced image.
.sp
The task takes each input file and carries out some of the following steps 
depending upon what parameter values are set:
.sp
(1) the file is checked for bad frames using the task TBACKGROUND (for T-ReCS
data only);
.sp
(2) the file is then checked interactively for bad frames using one of the 
tasks MIVIEW, TVIEW, or MVIEW as appropriate;
.sp
(3) a flat field frame is applied to each frame of the image;
.sp
(4) a bad pixel mask is applied to each frame of the image;
.sp
(5) the file is then "prepared" using TPREPARE or MPREPARE 
if this is required;
.sp
(6) the difference (or source, or reference, depending on the \fIframetype\fR
parameter) frames from the prepared file are then averaged--or 
summed depending on the \fIcombine\fR parameter value--either by stacking 
or by registering, to produce a single frame in the output file; and finally
.sp
(7) if requested, the resulting frame is displayed in the stdimage using 
the DISPLAY task.
.sp
The output MEF file has a primary header extension, [0], followed by 
one image MEF extension containing an image of size [320,240] of type 
DOUBLE.
.sp
One output file is produced for each input file.  If the number of input 
and output files listed do not match the task exits with an error condition. 
One can have automatically generated output file names by specifying the 
\fIoutpref\fR parameter and NOT specifying the \fIoutimages\fR parameter. 
If neither of these is specified, the \fIoutpref\fR parameter is set to be 
"r" for difference frames, "c" for source frames, or "a" for reference frames
depending on the \fIframetype\fR parameter.  One cannot overwrite the input 
file by the output file.
.sp
In case the input images are in a different directory than the current
one, the user can specify the \fIrawpath\fR parameter which is then prefixed 
to the input file name(s).
.sp
The \fIstackoption\fR determines the order in which the above steps are 
carried out.  If the option is "register" then steps (1) to (7) above are done 
as indicated.  If the option is "stack" then steps (5) and (6) are done 
before steps (3) and (4).  This saves time in the latter two steps because 
they are applied to the final images which have only one frame.
.sp
The routine writes to a logfile.  If the task logfile name is not specified 
then the routine looks for the MIDIR logfile name.  If that is also 
not specified, the logfile name is set to "mireduce.log".  If the logfile 
exists, any messages are appended to it.  The \fIverbose\fR parameter 
does not effect the logfile, but does change how much information is 
written to the terminal.
.sp
If the \fIfl_check\fR parameter is set to "no" then the checks for 
observation completion and for file integrity which are normally done in 
the TPREPARE task are carried out but do not stop the processing 
if an error is detected, as would usually be the case.  The tasks then 
do their best to carry out a minimum processing of the incomplete or 
failed observation.  Note that the processing may still fail depending on 
the exact nature of the problem with any given T-ReCS raw data file.
.sp
When \fIfl_check\fR is set to "no" this causes an override of the 
\fIfl_flat\fR, \fIfl_background\fR, and \fIfl_mask\fR flags, all of which are 
set to "no".  Only the minimum processing is done.  This is due to the 
difficultly of coding these other tasks to handle all possible types of 
incomplete or failed T-ReCS observations.
.sp
The \fIfl_check\fR flag currently only affects the processing of raw T-ReCS 
data files (aside from resetting flags as described in the last paragraph). 
No equivalent functionality is currently available for Michelle raw data 
files.

EXAMPLES
1. The basic usage is
.sp
.nf
     cl> mireduce S2003B0909S0012
.fi
.sp
which will produce an output file named "rS2003B0909S0012.fits". (This is 
assuming that there are no errors.)  In this case the original file must be in 
the current directory, and that is where the output file is created.
.sp
2. Using MIREDUCE for images in another directory is done as with 
.sp
.nf
    cl> mireduce S2003B0909S0012 rawpath="/home/user/trecs"
.fi
.sp
which would read "/home/user/trecs/S2003B0909S0012.fits" and produce an 
output file named "rS2003B0909S0012.fits" in the current directory if 
all goes well.
.sp
3. Defining the output file name works the following way:
.sp
.nf
    cl> mireduce S2003B0909S0012 outimages=frame12
.fi
.sp
which should produce "frame12.fits" from "S2003B0909S0012.fits", 
both files being in the current directory.
.sp
4. If one wants to define the prefix explicitly and apply it to all 
the images in a list it is done by
.sp
.nf
    cl> mireduce @file.list outpref="new" logfile="test.log" \
    >>> verbose=no
.fi
.sp
which produces an output file named "newS2003B0909S0012.fits" for an 
input file named "S2003B0909S0012" listed in file "files.list".  In this 
example the logfile name is set to "test.log" and the messages to the 
terminal are kept to a minimum by setting verbose to "no".
.sp
5. One can specify which steps to apply explicitly as in 
.sp
.nf
    cl> mireduce @file.list stackoption="register" fl_prepare=no \
    >>> fl_flat=no fl_mask=yes
.fi
.sp
which would apply the processing to the files listed in file "file.list" 
which must be output files from TPREPRARE or MPREPARE since 
the \fIfl_prepare\fR parameter is set to "no".  In this case the pipeline 
would apply a bad pixel mask but not a flat field frame, and when combining 
frames it would use registration.  It is assumed that the "preparing" of 
the files did not use any registration.  For Michelle files this would be 
the way to combine the images from each nod with registration, since the 
original raw Michelle files have one image per nod position created by 
stacking the individual short exposures done while chopping.
.sp
6. To obtain the total summed frame rather than an average frame 
.sp
.nf
    cl> mireduce S2003B0909S0012 outimages=frame12 combine="sum"
.fi
.sp
for which the output image for a Michelle file would multiplied by 2 
times the number of nods in the image compared to the 'combine="average"' 
case, and the output image for a T-ReCS file would be multiplied by 2 times 
the number of nods times the number of savesets per nod cycle compared to 
the 'combine"average"' case.
.sp
7. To produce an output image of the total on-source frames, atmosphere and 
source, one can use
.sp
.nf
 cl> mireduce S2003B0909S0012 frametype="src"
.fi
.sp
which produces file cS2003B0909S0012.fits along with the "prepared" file 
tS2003B0909S0012.fits in this case since the file is a T-ReCS raw data file.
