USAGE

PARAMETERS
.ls inimages 
Input, wavelength calibrated, extracted raw spectrum files for some object.
.le
.ls cal
The name of a single, wavelength calibrated, extracted raw spectrum file
for a calibration standard, to be used for telluric corrections and 
possibly absolute calibration.
.le
.ls stdname
The name of the standard star, so that its absolute energy distribution
can be used to calibrate the object spectrum.  If this parameter includes
the string "list" anywhere, the full list of standards will be printed 
back to the terminal and no processing will be done.  There are 490
"standards" in the list, primarily from the series of papers by Martin
Cohen and his associates.  Note that the quality of template data for different
objects in the list varies significantly. If \fIfl_bbody\fR is "yes" 
then the name is ignored but something still needs to be entered.  If the 
standard name is "asteroid" a blackbody spectral fit for an asteroid of 
diameter 100 km at a distance of 1.0 astronomical units will be used.  This 
has to be scaled to allow for the actual radius and distance of any particular 
asteroid.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
Final reduced output spectra.  If various of the 
\fIfl_view\fR, \fIfl_mask\fR, etc. options are chosen, the task will 
also generate other output files in the processing.
.le
.ls outpref = "a"
A prefix string, which is prefixed to the input image name(s) to make
the corresponding output image name(s) if the output file name(s) is 
not specified via the \fIoutimage\fR parameter.
.le
.ls outtype = "fnu"
Key for what type of flux units one wants in the output spectrum: one can 
specify "fnu" to get frequency flux density values in Jy, "flambda" to get 
wavelength flux density in Watts/meter squared per micron, or "lambdaFlambda" 
to get values in Watts/meter-squared.  This is only used if \fIfl_bbody\fR 
is "no".  In the blackbody case the output is wavelength flux density, but 
the scaling is arbitrary, no matter what the \fIouttype\fR parameter value 
is set to.
.le
.ls fl_bbody = no
This is a flag for whether the standard spectrum is assumed to be a 
blackbody or whether an absolute energy distribution function will be read 
in and used for the spectral shape.  In the latter case the shape of the 
spectrum will be correct (to the extent that the spectrum of the standard 
is approximated by a blackbody function) but the information about the 
absolute level will be lost.
.le
.ls bbody = 1.0
A value for the blackbody temperature of the standard in K, used only if 
\fIfl_bbody\fR is "yes".  For stars a value of 10000.0 is recommended. 
For an asteroid a value near 215 K should be used.  No check is made of 
the value, except that it must be something other than 1.0.
.le
.ls xcorr = no
Cross-correlate   the  input  spectrum  with  the  calibration 
spectrum to determine an shift  for  the  calibration  spectrum?
Only  regions  specified by the sample regions parameter will be
used in the cross-correlation.
.le
.ls lag = 10
The cross-correlation lag to use when xcorr = yes.  The lag is
given  in  pixels.  This is the distance to either side of the
initial shift over which the cross-correlation profile is 
computed.  If a value of zero is given then  the 
cross-correlation step is not done.
.le
.ls shift = 0., dshift = 0.5
The  initial  shift  and shift step in pixels.  This initializes
the shift search parameters for the first spectrum.   If  dshift
is  zero  then  there  will be no search for a new shift and the
'x' interactive function is disabled.  These parameters  may  be
changed  interactively.   After  the  first  spectrum subsequent
spectra begin with the values from the last spectrum.
.le
.ls scale = 1., dscale = 0.1
The  initial  scale  and scale step.  This initializes the scale
search parameters for the first spectrum.   If  dscale  is  zero
then  there  will  be  no  search  for  a  new scale and the 'y'
interactive function  is  disabled.   These  parameters  may  be
changed  interactively.   After  the  first  spectrum subsequent
spectra begin with the values from the last spectrum.
.le
.ls threshold = 0.01
Since  the  calibration  consists  of  division  by  the  scaled 
calibration data it is possible for totally saturated  lines  to
have  zero  or  negative  values.  The task will quit if detects
negative or  zero  calibration  values.   The  threshold  allows
applying  a  minimum  threshold to the calibration values so the
task may continue.
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
A boolean value to toggle on or off the interactive tweaking of the
correction.
.le
.ls fl_plots = yes
A boolean value to toggle whether some plots are displayed as the 
reduction proceeds (these show the raw object and standard star spectra 
and the output spectrum using splot) and whether an output calibrated 
spectrum is written for the standard star.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by midir.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the terminal.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION 
This task carries out the calibration of an object spectrum, using a
calibration spectrum for telluric correction and sensitivity
corrections.  Depending on the options chosen the task will either
carry out an absolute calibration using a spectral energy distribution
function for the standard, or carry out a relative calibration
assuming that the calibration standard has an intrinsic spectral shape
given by the blackbody function. The file "standards.list" In the
midir$data directory gives the names of all the standards for which
the spectral energy distribution values are tabulated. The SEDs in the
standard star templates extend from 7 to 30 microns, so values in the
observed spectra outside that range are set to zero. The atmosphere is
essentially opaque outside that range of wavelengths.
.sp 
In the blackbody case the 
spectrum is normalized at either 11.7 microns (for a low resolution N-band
spectrum), 20.5 microns (for a low resolution Q-band spectrum), or the 
center wavelength of the spectrum (when the spectrum covers a wavelength 
range of less than 3 microns); thus no absolute flux information is 
retained.  The task corrects the calibration star spectrum for the 
assumed continuum shape, then uses the result to divide out the telluric 
atmospheric absorption features in the science spectrum.  The telluric 
correction is done using a call to the NOAO onedspec task \fITELLURIC\fR. 
.sp
One output file per input image is produced.  One can have automatically 
generated output file names by specifying the \fIoutpref\fR parameter and NOT 
specifying the \fIoutimage\fR parameter.  If neither of these is specified, 
the \fIoutpref\fR parameter is set to be "a".  One cannot overwrite the 
input file by the output file.
.sp
Only one target can be handled at a time by this routine, because 
the standard star name has to be specified when the \fIfl_bbody\fR 
flag is set to "no".  While it would be possible to have a list of standard 
stars as well as list of input and output spectra, that has not been done. 
Normally there is a separate standard star spectrum for each science 
spectrum when Gemini observations are carried out, and that has been 
assumed to be the case here.
.sp
The routine writes to a logfile.  If the task logfile name is not specified 
then the routine looks for the MIDIR logfile name.   If the logfile 
exists, any messages are appended to it.  The \fIverbose\fR parameter 
does not effect the logfile, but does change how much information is 
written to the terminal.
.sp
As well as using the standard star spectral templates, it is possible to 
use an "asteroid" template spectrum.  That spectrum is based upon 
observations of Ceres with the Infrared Space Observatory.  A single 
temperature blackbody fit was used.  The resulting best fit temperature 
was 217.05 K assuming an emissivity of of 1.0.  The spectrum was scaled 
to the expected flux for a 100 km radius asteroid at a distance of 1 A.U..  
This template can be used if the calibration spectrum is from an asteroid, 
as may be the case for higher resolution spectral observations, particularly 
from the echelle mode of Michelle.  It should be noted that this single 
temperature fit is not nearly as good as using a physical model of the 
shape and surface properties of individual asteroids (see for example 
T. G. Muller and J. S. V. Lagerros, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 
volume 338, 340-352, 1998).  The application of such a model is 
beyond the scope of the midir package.
.sp
The \fIfl_bbody\fR option can be used with a \fIbbody\fR value of around 
210 to 220 K if the calibration target is an asteroid.  This may be important 
at short wavelengths (less than 8 microns in particular) where the shape of 
the blackbody function is a strong function of temperature at around these 
values.
.sp
While this task can be called on its own, it is intended to be called 
as part of the \fImsreduce\fR and \fImsslice\fR tasks.
.ih
USE of the TELLURIC task
The ratioing and scaling of the two input spectra to produce the output 
calibrated spectrum is carried out using the \fItelluric\fR routine.  That 
routine applies a shift to the calibration spectrum to best match the object 
spectrum, and also applies a scaling as a form of airmass correction.  The 
automatic usage of \fItelluric\rR does not generally produce the best possible 
result for Gemini mid-infrared spectra.  It is advisable to run the task 
interactively and search for a better set of parameters than those found 
automatically.
.sp
Experience with mid-infrared spectra in the N-band and the Q-band from Gemini 
suggests that the best way to proceed within the \fItelluric\rfR task is to 
set the SCALE parameter to 1.0 and then look for a (small) shift which 
produces a smooth output spectrum across the telluric features, such as the 
ozone band in the N-band window and the many strong water bands in the 
Q-band window.  These spectra include regions of extremely strong 
atmospheric absorption, where no signal is detected  It is these regions 
which make it difficult for the \fItelluric\fR task to find the best shift and 
scaling as they produce large positive and negative values which are not 
actually meaningful.  The task tends to choose a shift which minimizes the 
large positive and negative values in the regions where the spectrum has no 
information at the expense of producing a bad result in the regions of the 
spectrum where there is actual signal.  Shifts of more than 1 pixel positive 
or negative are not needed, unless there was a problem with the grating 
positioning during an observation.  It is also observed that the airmass 
scaling is usually close to 1.0 unless the difference in airmass between the 
science target observation and the standard star observation is quite large. 
Variations in the atmosphere (water vapour column, or ozone column) turn out 
to often have a much bigger affect on the spectral shape than airmass usually 
does.
.sp
In general it may take a number of attempts to get the best shift and scaling 
for a particular spectral observation.  On both N-band and Q-band the strength 
of the molecular absorption bands is sometimes observed to change noticeably 
on short times scales (30 minutes or less).  In some cases this may prevent 
the telluric correction from working at all.  More usually it has been found 
that shifts of up to + or - 0.3 pixels serve to cancel out the bands as well 
as is possible.

EXAMPLES
1. The basic usage is
.sp
.nf
     cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 HD29291
.fi
.sp
which will produce an output file named "axtrS20031228S0175.fits". (This is 
assuming that there are no errors.)  In this case the original files must 
be in the current directory, and that is where the output file is created.
.sp
2. Using MSABSFLUX for spectra in another directory is done as with 
.sp
.nf
    cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 HD29291 \
    >>> rawpath=/home/user/trecs
.fi
.sp
which would read "/home/user/trecs/xtrS20031228S0175.fits", and produce an 
output file named "axtrS20031228S0175.fits" in the current directory if 
all goes well.  The calibration spectrum would be read from 
"/home/user/trecs/xtrS20031228S0176.fits".
.sp
3. Defining the output file name works the following way:
.sp
.nf
    cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 HD29291 \
    >>> outim=frame175
.fi
.sp
which should produce "frame75.fits" from "xtrS20031228S0175", 
both files being in the current directory.
.sp
4. If one wants to define the prefix explicitly and apply it to  
the original spectrum file name it is done by
.sp
.nf
    cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 HD29291 \
    >>> outpref="new" logfile="test.log" verbose=no
.fi
.sp
which produces an output file named "newxtrS20031228S0175.fits" for an 
input file named "xtrS20031228S0175".  In this example the logfile name 
is set to "test.log" and the messages to the terminal are kept to a 
minimum by setting verbose to "no".
.sp
5. To run the routine using a cross correlation in the call to the 
\fItelluric\fR task:
.sp
.nf
    cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 HD29291 \
    >>> fl_xcorr+
.fi
.sp
which will do a cross correlation of the science target and the telluric 
standard, and determine, and then apply, a shift to the data before the 
division is done.
.sp
6. To do only a telluric correction and relative flux calibration assuming 
a blackbody shape for the calibration spectrum:
.sp
.nf
    cl> msabsflux xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 " " \
    >>> fl_bbody+ bbody=10000.
.fi
.sp
which then produces a spectrum with arbitrary scaling in intensity.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
At the present time, the best automatically processed output spectrum is 
obtained when MSABSFLUX is run with the xcorr keyword set to "no".  
However, much better cross correlation correction of the telluric features 
can usually be obtained if the task is run interactively with the cross 
correlation option on (i.e., with xcorr+ and fl_inter+).
