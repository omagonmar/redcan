DESCRIPTION
The midir package contains tasks for processing mid-IR data from
the Michelle and T-ReCS instruments at Gemini Observatory.  The specifics of 
the individual tasks can be found in their help files. This document describes 
the common features of the tasks and gives a description of the mid IR data 
format.  Spectroscopy data taken with the mid-IR instruments is processed 
primarily using tasks in the GNIRS package, as it can be treated as generic 
long-slit spectroscopy data after some initial reduction steps.

The tasks are designed to provide a fairly complete and flexible
reduction for the purpose of assessing data quality.  Real-time reductions 
may not be optimal for a particular science application.  The tasks produce 
logfiles of the performed processing steps.  The name of the logfile may be 
set in each individual task, or at the package level by setting
\fImidir.logfile\fR.  The tasks add header keywords to the output images. 
These header keywords contain information about the performed processing 
steps and timestamps for each step of the reduction.

The basic file structure for raw mid-IR data is a multi-extension FITS file 
with the primary header in extension 0, and one or more image extensions 
containing co-added T-ReCS or Michelle data frames.  For CHOP or STARE 
mode observations there will be only one extension.  For CHOP-NOD or  
NOD  mode  there will  be  one extension per NOD position.  Each extension 
contains a small FITS extension header with some of the parameters specific 
to the individual images -- such as the start and end UT times and the 
airmass. (For CHOP or STARE mode with just one extension these could have 
been put in the primary header, but for MEF files with more than one 
extension the values change for each image extension.)  The extension then 
has the images themselves.  Each image is made up of one or more co-added 
raw frames from T-ReCS or Michelle.  Each raw frame is a [320,240] array 
of data values of type LONG or DOUBLE.
 
The format of the image(s) in the extension(s) depends upon the mode of the 
observation and on which instrument, T-ReCS or Michelle, was used to obtain 
the data.  They all contain one or several, usually more than one, frames.  
For Michelle data obtained in CHOP and CHOP-NOD mode, each image extension 
is three dimensional: [320,240,3] where frames from each chop position are 
combined to form chopA and chopB position images, and these are differenced 
to form a dif frame.  These three (chopA, chopB and dif) co-added images are 
delineated in the third data dimension in each image extension.  In turn 
each of these images is a result of stacking a number of frames with 
exposure time of order 25 milliseconds internally in Michelle during the 
time at each NOD position.  This "frame time" is chosen to avoid saturation 
of the individual frames due to the high mid-infrared background from the 
atmosphere and the telescope.

When chopping with T-ReCS, there are frames from each chop position.  In that 
case a pair of co-added frames from the chop positions are called a saveset.  
In STARE mode or NOD mode, where there is no chopping, one has a number 
of co-added frames written out during the observation at a given nod position, 
and the image dimension is [320,320,1,N] where N stands for the number of 
savesets written out during the observation.  This N value is determined by 
the T-ReCS set-up and the total exposure time.  In  CHOP or CHOP-NOD mode 
one has two chop positions per saveset and some number M of savesets.  
The image size is then [320,240,2,M].  The most common observation 
mode is CHOP-NOD mode, and each extension contains the savesets for a 
single NOD position. The T-ReCS NOD observations are done by starting 
at NOD position A and then going to NOD position B for the same length 
of time.  With T-ReCS the telescope then returns to NOD position A and 
observations are taken in ABABABAB pattern.  Proper NOD or CHOP-NOD 
observations with T-ReCS therefore should have an even number of 
image extensions.

As with Michelle, the actual "frame time" of T-ReCS observations is short, 
of order 25 milliseconds for a typical imaging observation and somewhat 
longer for a typical spectroscopy observation, and a number of these 
frames are accumulated by co-adding in internal buffers for the two chop 
positions in the normal case of chopping observations.  At the end of the 
specified saveset time, normally 10 seconds, the stacked images are written 
out to the FITS extension.  Thus there are three distinct "exposure times" 
for T-ReCS data: the frame time, the saveset time, and the total exposure 
time.

In a normal T-ReCS chop-nod mode raw data file the images in each extension 
have dimension [320,240,2,N] where N is the number of savesets per nod 
position.  This value is given in the primary FITS header as the NSAVSETS 
value.

To calculate the number of frames co-added by T-ReCS for a saveset one uses 
the FRMCOADD and CHPCOADD, values in the primary header of the MEF 
file.  The number of frames co-added is the product of the FRMCOADD and 
CHPCOADD values (the number of frames co-added per chop position times the 
number of chop cycles per saveset).  This number of frames times the 
FRMTIME parameter gives the exposure time per saveset on the target field, 
in milli-seconds.  For flux calibration one can directly compare T-ReCS 
raw difference images that have the same time on source per saveset.  
If the images differ in the FRMTIME, FRMCOADD, or CHPCOADD, values 
then one would need to scale to a common saveset exposure time before 
comparing images.

For Michelle the analogous keywords are EXPOSURE and NUMEXPOS, the
product of which gives the observation time per nod position.  This
value is the exposure time on target per nod position when carrying
out chop-nod mode observations.  The time spent actually collecting
data per nod is twice this since the target is in the (guided) beam
only half the time.

When data are obtained in CHOP or STARE mode for each instrument the output 
data structure is the same as NOD or CHOP-NOD mode except that there is 
only one NOD position.  A STARE mode observation is treated as a long 
NOD observation in NOD position A.  A CHOP mode observation is treated 
as a long CHOP-NOD observation in NOD position A.  STARE and CHOP mode 
observations are assumed to have only one data extension whereas those 
done in NOD or CHOP-NOD mode are assumed to have an even number of 
data extensions.

The main differences in data format between Michelle and T-ReCS are:
.ls o 
T-ReCS generally saves multiple accumulated savesets per NOD position, 
whereas Michelle saves one accumulated image per NOD position
.le
.ls o 
T-ReCS has an ABABABAB nodding pattern, whereas Michelle normally 
uses an ABBAABBA nodding pattern
.le
.ls o
T-ReCS stores values as type LONG, and Michelle stores them as type DOUBLE
.le
.ls o
The internal format of frames within the image sections differ between T-ReCS 
and Michelle.
.le
.sp
The tasks TPREPARE and MPREPARE are designed to transform the individual image 
formats of the two instruments into a common format, as well as harmonizing 
the FITS header keywords.

In order to have a common format for files from the Michelle and T-ReCS 
instruments, the format of the "prepared" files was defined as follows:
.ls Chopping Observations: (CHOP or CHOP-NOD mode)
    
For each NOD position, the output file from TPREPARE or MPREPARE has an image 
extension with size [320,240,3] of type DOUBLE.  The three "planes" of this 
three-dimensional image are the on-source co added image, in image section 
[*,*,1], the off-source co-added image, in image section [*,*,2,], and the 
difference image [*,*,1] - [*,*,2] image section [*,*,3].  These are in 
ADU co-added over some number of individual frames as discussed above.
.le    
.ls Non-chopping Observations: (STARE or NOD mode)
    
For each  NOD position (only one for STARE mode, presumably an even number for 
NOD mode) the output file from TPREPARE or MPREPARE has an image extension with
size [320,240] of type DOUBLE containing the sum of frames taken on the 
target field.

Currently higher resolution Michelle spectroscopy is taken in NOD-only mode.  
This applies to any spectroscopic observations with Michelle that do not use 
the low resolution N-band or Q-band gratings.  When such files are prepared 
using the MPREPARE task the nod A and nod B positions are subtracted so that 
one should be left with two spectra, one positive, one negative, on the 
resulting stacked image.  The spectral reduction routines are able to extract 
both the positive and negative spectra which then can be co-added for further 
analysis.

For Michelle the spectral flat and bias observations are done in stare mode.
.le
.ls Polarimetry mode
.sp
Michelle has a polarimetry mode.  There is no such mode in T-ReCS.  
Polarimetric observations are taken in chop-nod mode but with a half-wave plate
inserted into the beam.  The plate is rotated to different angles and short 
observations are taken, and after the plate has cycled through the different 
positions all these images are written out as one image extension in the 
raw data file.
.sp
The waveplate is rotated to angles 0, 45, 45, 0, 22.5, 67.5, 67.5, and 22.5 
degrees during each nod.  Thus a total of 8 images are collected and the 
raw data extension is an image of dimension [320,340,3,8] in this case.  The 
last index in the image is for each of the waveplate positions in order as 
listed here.  This abba type pattern of the waveplates is designed to 
take out any linear trends with time in the background, just as the ABBA 
nod pattern does for normal imaging.  When a polarimetry file is "prepared" 
one gets 8 output extensions for each input extension, one per waveplate 
position.  There is a header keyword inserted that indicates the waveplate 
angle.

SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TASKS

TPREPARE and MPREPARE are used on the raw T-ReCS and Michelle data, 
respectively, in order to collapse and reformat the images into the same data 
structure.  The TBACKGROUND task can be run on T-ReCS images to derive 
statistics on the background flux in each chop saveset, and flag bad sets so 
they are not co-added in TPREPARE.  Raw T-ReCS and Michelle data frames can be 
viewed and, should the user desire, examined interactively using the TVIEW and 
MVIEW routines, respectively.  These tasks allow the user to examine each data 
image (using IMEXAMINE) and flag bad chop savesets (T-ReCS) or nods (Michelle).
The TPREPARE and MPREPARE tasks collapse the T-ReCS chop frames and reorganize 
the Michelle data so the output has the same file structure.  
.sp
Following the processing with the *PREPARE scripts, the data can be viewed and 
examined using MIVIEW.  Like TVIEW and MVIEW, MIVIEW allows the user to examine
each frame (using IMEXAMINE), derive statistics, and flag nods as BAD for 
exclusion from the final data coaddition.
.sp
For CHOP-NOD and NOD mode data the nod sets for each data image are collapsed 
into a single [320,240] image with the MISTACK or MIREGISTER tasks.  Both of 
these routines require that the input frames have been prepared either with 
TPREPARE or MPREPARE.  MISTACK merely averages (or sums, if the \fIcombine\fR 
task parameter is changed to "sum" from the default of "average") each frame by
co-adding the signal from each nod position and dividing by the number of 
frames. MIREGISTER combines the nod frames by using the 
IMAGES.IMMATCH.XREGISTER task in IRAF to shift the frames before they are 
averaged (again, or summed if \fIcombine\fR is set to "sum").
.sp
The default behavior is to average the images, whether they are simply added 
as is or whether they are registered first.  In that case the effective 
exposure time remains the same as for an individual image in the raw data, 
the on-source time per saveset for T-ReCS and the on-source time per nod 
position for Michelle.  An alternative is to form the sum of the images 
rather than the average, in which case the total on-source exposure time 
applies to the final image.  This behavior is selected by the \fIcombine\fR 
task parameter in MIREDUCE, TPREPARE, MISTACK, and MIREGISTER.  This in 
turn is passed as the \fIcombine\fR parameter for the IMCOMBINE task which 
is used to combine the images. The task MIPSF is used to measure the FWHM and
the Strehl value for either Michelle or T-ReCS images.
.sp
All of the afore-mentioned reduction steps for each T-ReCS or Michelle raw data
file can be done with one call to the MIREDUCE task.  By default, MIREDUCE 
will identify if a file is from T-ReCS or Michelle, run TPREPARE or MPREPARE 
on the image, and, if needed on NOD or CHOP-NOD data, it will combine the nod 
positions using MISTACK.  The \fIfl_view\fR and \fIfl_background\fR keywords 
can be flagged if the user wishes to interactively view the images or test 
the background statistics (the latter for T-ReCS data, only).  At the present 
time, a bad pixel mask is not applied to the data in the MIREDUCE call, but the
\fIfl_flat\fR keyword can be set and a flat field image defined for the 
MIFLAT routine to apply a flat-field correction to T-ReCS images (only).  The 
\fIstackoption\fR parameter can be set to "stack" or "register", and the 
MIREDUCE routine will call the appropriate combining script, MISTACK or 
MIREGISTER to combine the data. The MICLEAN task can be used to remove pattern 
noise and channel-channel offsets from the combined images, if desired. The 
task MISTDFLUX is used to find the in-band filter flux density of a standard
star.
.sp
Imaging polarimetry observations (see below) cannot be reduced by the 
MIREDUCE task.  It applies only to regular imaging observations.
.sp
Most of the midir reduction tasks can be called with multiple data images in a 
list format (i.e., "@inlist").  The tasks have the option of setting a 
\fIrawpath\fR parameter to point to the appropriate directory where 
the raw data resides.  The output filename can be defined for single 
images, in a list for multiple images ("@outlist"), or an output prefix 
can be prefixed to the name of the input file.  For additional information 
and syntax for each step of the midir data reduction package, see the help 
file included for each task.
.sp
For spectroscopy observations the initial processing to produce a single 
stacked or registered image is carried out in the same way as for imaging
observations.  From there one needs to carry out a series of steps to 
extract and calibrate the spectrum, assuming that there is also a spectrum 
of a standard star available to use in the analysis.  These steps use 
various tasks in the GNIRS package.  The recommended processing 
steps are outlined in the next section.  Some spectroscopy 
tasks are currently available in the MIDIR package, all of which start with an 
MS prefix.  These include MSDEFRINGE, MSREDUCE, MSSLICE, MSFLATCOR, MSTELLURIC 
and MSABSFLUX

.ih
SPECTROSCOPY REDUCTIONS

If one wishes to produce a calibrated spectrum one has to run all 
the steps in the reduction except the last one (running MSTELLURIC) 
for both the observation of the science target and the observation 
of a standard star.  Thus steps (1) to (8) below would normally 
be done twice to produce wavelength calibrated spectra for the two 
targets, and then step (9) would be done with these two spectra 
to produce the final calibrated spectrum of the object.  

To carry out a normal spectroscopic reduction the following steps 
are required:
.ls (0) Define the instrument parameters with NSHEADERS
.sp
Before carrying out any reduction steps using the GNIRS routines 
one needs to run the NSHEADERS task with the correct instrument 
name ("michelle" or "trecs").
.le
.ls (1) For Michelle spectra, optionally do a flat fielding and 
bias correction using the MSFLATCOR task
.sp
This step is optional, and only applies to Michelle observations 
since it has not proved possible to obtain analogous flat field 
frames with T-ReCS.  
.le
.ls (2) Stack the object raw data file with MIREDUCE
.sp
This is the normal processing which produces a stacked or registered
image from the raw data.  The resulting file contains the long-slit 
spectrum of the target.
.le
.ls (3) Produce a sky file for the object with MIREDUCE
.sp
The wavelength calibration is done with the sky spectrum rather than 
with the object spectrum.  This requires extracting the stacked 
reference images from the original raw data file to produce a sky 
spectrum image.  This image is used with the NSWAVE task in the 
GNIRS package.
.sp
Except for the last step to correct for atmospheric effects all 
the rest of the processing is done with tasks in the GNIRS package.
.le
.ls (4) Optionally, subtract pattern noise and remove channel-channel 
offsets with MICLEAN
.sp
The files output by MIREDUCE in steps 2 and 3 can be cleaned using the
MICLEAN task, if desired.
.le
.ls (5) Identify the sky emission lines with NSWAVE
.sp
In this step certain atmospheric emission features are identified 
for a small aperture through the center of the sky spectrum.  This 
defines the wavelength calibration of the spectrum.  As most of the 
atmospheric emission features in the N-band or Q-band are blends at 
low spectral resolution, one cannot use the same line list at low and 
at high resolution.  For both Michelle and T-ReCS in the low resolution 
mode the dispersion is nearly linear.  In the higher spectral resolution 
modes this need not be the case.
.le
.ls (6) Find the wavelength transformation function with NSTRANSFORM
.sp
Here the lines identified in the central part of the sky image are 
re-identified for other parts of the image and based on this a 
wavelength function lambda(x,y) is defined over the while image. 
This is then applied to the object spectrum in the next step.
.le
.ls (7) Extract the spectrum with NSEXTRACT
.sp
Now the stacked difference spectrum is used to trace and extract 
the object spectrum in the usual manner.  The wavelength solution 
is taken from the transformation derived in step (6).  The output 
is a wavelength calibrated raw spectrum of the object. Alternatively, 
the MSSLICE task can be used instead of NSEXTRACT to extract multiple 
T-ReCS or Michelle  spectra across an extended object, with an optional 
call to MSABSFLUX (step 9).
.le
.ls (8) Defringe the spectrum with MSDEFRINGE, if that is required
.sp
Many spectra from T-ReCS and Michelle are subject to significant 
fringing, which depends on the wavelength resolution, the wavelength, 
and the slit width that are used.  It is usually possible to screen 
out the fringes using filtering in the fourier domain.  This is done 
with the MSDEFRINGE task.  For low resolution spectra the fringing 
(if it is seen) has the highest possible pixel frequency and can be 
filtered out automatically.  However for higher spectral resolution 
observations the frequencies to be filtered cannot be determined 
automatically.  Thus the MSDEFRINGE task needs to be run interactively.
.le
.ls (9) Correct for the atmosphere with MSTELLURIC or MSABSFLUX
.sp
Over most of the N-band and all of Q-band there are significant 
atmospheric absorption effects.  These are removed by dividing the 
spectrum of the object with that of a standard observed
at a similar airmass.  The quotient spectrum can then be scaled by the 
proper spectral shape of the standard star to produce a flux calibrated 
spectrum of the object.
.sp
This process is carried out by the MSTELLURIC or MSABSFLUX tasks, which 
call the TELLURIC task in NOAO.ONEDSPEC package.  It requires as 
input the two wavelength calibrated spectra from step (5), for the 
object and for the standard, and a description of the spectral shape 
of the standard.  This can either be a blackbody function, when MSTELLURIC
is used, or a spectral energy distribution template, when MSABSFLUX is 
used.  The end spectrum made using MSTELLURIC has the correct shape--to 
the extent that the spectrum of the standard follows the blackbody function--
but has arbitrary normalization.  The end spectrum made using MSABSFLUX is 
absolutely calibrated subject to the question of slit losses.
.le


.ih
THE MSREDUCE TASK
Starting with the 2006 release of the midir package there is a pipeline 
spectral reduction task MSREDUCE which carries out any or all of the various 
steps outlined above (with the exception of MICLEAN, which has not yet been
integrated into MSREDUCE).  This task calls all of the spectral reduction tasks
in the midir package.  It is not yet possible to automate all aspects of the 
reduction, and it is strongly advised that at least the wavelength calibration 
be carried out interactively.  As noted above, defringing of the spectra, if 
needed, must also be done interactively.
.sp
The MSREDUCE task can either carry out a full reduction of a pair of spectra 
(i.e. one for the science target, one for a standard) through to produce a 
calibrated spectrum or it can be used to just produce a wavelength 
calibrated individual spectrum without calibration of the intensity.
.sp

.ih
POLARIMETRY
Imaging polarimetry is offered by Michelle starting in 2006B.  A group of 
polarimetry routines have been added to the package to aid reduction of these 
types of observations.  The raw data consists of short observations through 
four positions of a waveplate, corresponding to the selection of polarized 
radiation at position angles 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees.  The MPREPARE 
task is able to recognize polarimetry observations, and it splits the original 
observations into MEF extensions, one extension per waveplate position.  The 
observations are taken in CHOP-NOD mode with 8 waveplate positions observed 
per nod: the waveplate angle sequence is 0, 45, 45, 0, 22.5, 67.5, 67.5, and 
22.5 degrees (where the selection angle is twice the waveplate angle).  The 
time per waveplate position is short, only a few seconds, so that the time 
per NOD position is not much longer than in regular imaging mode.  Thus the 
signal-to-noise ratio per extension is significantly lower in polarimetry 
mode than it is in the analogous regular imaging mode, and the total number 
of data extensions is MUCH larger for a given total time on target.
.sp
Aside from MPREPARE, all the tasks that are used on polarimetry mode data 
files are named with prefix "MIP".
.sp
After being reformatted with the MPREPARE task, the polarimetry files can have 
the images from each waveplate position stacked up using the MIPSTACK task.  
The resulting four waveplate position images can be transformed into Stokes 
parameter (I, U, Q) images using the MIPTRANS task.  Alternatively one can make
Stokes parameter images for each AB nod pair (which then removes the radiative 
offset contribution) using the MIPSTOKES task and then combine these to form a 
set of stacked Stokes parameter images using the MIPSSTK task.  In these cases 
the output files include not only the Stokes (I, U, and Q) images but also 
additional extensions giving the unpolarized flux, the polarized flux, the 
percent polarization, and the polarization angle in degrees.  All of these 
additional images are calculated from the Stokes I, U, and Q images in a fairly
simple manner.  MIPQL carries out a calculation of the Stokes parameters and 
polarization vectors from stacked data. Other software external to IRAF and the
Gemini package (such as the Starlink software) may produce much better results 
than these simple tasks are able to.
.sp
For all the polarimetry tasks that combine images there is an option of 
registering the original images to make the stacked images.  This is generally 
recommended as long as there is something bright and compact in the field of 
view.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
At the present time, MIFLAT will only work with data obtained with T-ReCS.  
This task has not been tested with flat-field data obtained with Michelle.  
.sp
The NSWAVELENGTH task does not usually produce good initial identifications of 
the spectral lines for low resolution N-band spectroscopy.  In most cases the 
automatic IDs that are assigned when the task is started are simply way off, 
and it is necessary to clear the identifications and do them interactively.
.sp
We do not yet have a line list for high resolution spectroscopy in either the 
N or Q windows, particularly for the Michelle echelle mode.
