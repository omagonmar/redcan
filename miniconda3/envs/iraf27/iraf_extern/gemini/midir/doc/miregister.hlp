NAME
miregister -- Register and average the nod images within a given data file
.ih
USAGE
miregister inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task. It can be an image name, 
a list of image names, a wild-card image name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
files that have been made by the TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output image name(s) for the registered files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "x"
A prefix string which is prepended to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The path to the directory containing the T-ReCS or Michelle image files.  
If the value is "" (empty string) the current directory is used.
.le
.ls combine = "average"
A variable which can have the values "average" or "sum".  This determines 
whether the combination of images is done via averaging or by summation. 
This variable is passed to the IMCOMBINE task as its \fIcombine\fR 
parameter.  Any value aside from "average" or "sum" produces an error.
.le
.ls fl_variance = no
If this flag is set to "yes" then when the images from the individual nod 
pair images are combined the variance is also calculated and written to the 
output file as a second extension.
.le
.ls region = "[*,*]"
This parameter is passed onto XREGISTER, defining the region of the 
images which are used in registration.  The default, and the "old" behaviour 
of this task before revision in early 2006, is to use the entire image for 
registration.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task, which may be called as part of the standard reduction pipeline 
in MIREDUCE, takes one or more input midir image files and combines   
the difference frames from the various nods after using the XREGISTER task
to attempt to correct any small shifts from image to image.  The 
resulting output MEF file contains one or two extensions depending 
on the \fIfl_variance\fR flag.  If this flag is "no" then the output 
image has a single extension in which the combined frame is stored.  
This image has dimension [320,240].  All input images have equal 
weight in the averaging or summation.  If the \fIfl_variance\fR flag 
is set to "yes" then there is an additional second extension in the 
output file which contains the variance image.
.sp
The first "good" frame is used as reference for the registration of the 
set of images.  The part of the image specified by the \fIregions\fR 
parameter is used for the registration. No checks are made as to the 
validity of any shift, so the user needs to examine the log file to 
see what the shifts were and needs to look at the output image to see 
whether the result of the registration is reasonable.
.sp
The registration process works well only if there is a reasonably strong 
source, preferably an extended source, in the T-ReCS or Michelle field of 
view.  It also works when there is a point source present, but initial tests 
indicated that this does not improve the FWHM of the point source profile so 
it is possible that using MISTACK is preferable when dealing with 
stellar images, especially of standard stars where the total exposure time 
is going to be relatively short.  In some cases a better registration 
is obtained by defining a smaller region around the target with the 
\fIregions\fR parameter.  This can only be determined by experimentation.  
If the region specified is too small the shifts may not be good.
.sp
The task will exit with an error if the specified output file already exists 
or if the input file is not the output of TPREPARE or MPREPARE.
It will also fail with a system level error if there are no good frames in 
a given input file.
.sp
If the input file specified has already been combined (either with MISTACK 
or with MIREGISTER), then no output file is produced.  In this case a message 
is printed to the logfile but no error is flagged.
.sp 
The \fIcombine\fR parameter is passed to the IMCOMBINE task and 
determines whether the individual nod position images are averaged (the 
default) or summed.  The output images for the two different "combine" 
parameter values are identical except for a factor of 2 times the 
number of nod cycles in the image.

EXAMPLE
1. Register a T-ReCS image located in "/home/user/data":
.sp
.nf
    cl> miregister tS20030916S0101 rawpath="/home/user/data"
.fi
.sp
This command would look in directory /home/user/data for input file, which 
would have been previously produced using TPREPARE.  It will produce an
output file named "xfS20030916S0101" in the current directory.  All "GOOD" 
images in the file are registered first and then averaged using 
IMCOMBINE with equal weights.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.sp
Use of the XREGISTER routine to register the images does not always work 
well.  It is always necessary for the user to carefully examine the results 
of the registration, and is it useful to compare the results of using 
MISTACK to those of using MIREGISTER to see whether the use of registration 
has actually improved the resulting image.
