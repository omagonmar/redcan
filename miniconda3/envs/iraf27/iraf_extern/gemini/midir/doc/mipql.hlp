NAME
mipql -- Carry out a calculation of the Stokes parameters and polarization
vectors from a stacked Michelle polarimetry file
.ih
USAGE
mipql inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task.  The files must have been
generated with the MIPSTACK task.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
An optional path name where the input files are located.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The names of the output cleaned images.  If the names are defined, the 
number of output images must equal the number of input images.  This 
option supersedes the \fIoutpref\fR option.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "p"
A prefix to the input file names to generate the output file names.  Used only 
if \fIoutimages\fR is blank.
.le
.ls fl_mask = yes
Attempt to mask out pixels with values at the noise level.  If \fIfl_mask\fR 
is "no" then all pixels have the transformation applied to them, and where the 
pixels originally contain only noise values the polarization fraction and 
polarization angle will have meaningless values.  If \fIfl_mask\fR is "yes" 
then the U and Q Stokes parameter images will have all the pixels with a 
percent polarization fraction accuracy lower than \fIthreshold\fR set to zero.
If \fIfl_negative\fR the pixels with negative value are also reset to zero.
All this is done before calculating the other polarization images Iu, Ip, p,
and theta.
.le
.ls threshold = 0.5  (min=0.5)
Minimum desired polarization percentage.  This value is used with 
\fIfl_mask\fR=yes.  All positive pixels with a signal-to-noise ratio large 
enough to allow this level of percent polarization will be retained, the other 
pixels will be masked to zero.  The noise level is either set by the 
\fInoise\fR parameter or estimated from the region of the total intensity image
(I Stokes parameter image) defined by the \fIblankarea\fR parameter.
.le
.ls noise = 0.
Set the noise level (in ADU) manually.  Used only if greater than 0.  If set 
to 0. (default) or less than 0., then statistics from the region defined by
\fIblankarea\fR is used instead.
.le
.ls blankarea = "[*,*]"
This region of the I Stokes parameter image will be used to estimate the 
noise per pixel.  This is taken to be the standard deviation of the pixels 
in this area.  The area should be source-free.
.le
.ls fl_negative = yes
Mask the pixels with negative values.  This is done only if \fIfl_mask\fR=yes.
.le
.ls fl_register = no
Register the four images from the four wave-plate positions before the 
calculation of the Stokes parameters is done.  The task XREGISTER from the 
package images.immatch is used.  If set to 'yes', the parameter \fIregions\fR 
must be set to an image section that contains a bright source
.le
.ls regions = "[*,*]"
This parameter specifies an image section to be used for registration of the 
individual wave-plate images before the calculation of the Stokes parameters 
is done.  This is used only if the \fIfl_register\fR parameter is set to "yes".
If the entire image is used for registration the results may be poor.  
Generally it is best to define a small box around a bright object.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. This 
parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task takes the four Michelle polarimetry mode images and uses the standard
equations to calculate the Stokes parameters for linear polarization, I, U and 
Q; from these the unpolarized and polarized components of the image are derived
as well as the polarization fraction and polarization angle.  The input file is
assumed to be the output from the MIPSTACK task.
.sp
There is an option to register the images with the XREGISTER routine 
before carrying out the transformation.  This is recommended if there is a 
relatively bright object in the field.  If this is done, a box needs to be 
defined around the object, with something like 10 pixels space on all sides. 
The image section to use for registration is defined in the \fIregions\fR 
parameter.  Generally using the entire image for registration does not produce 
the best results, especially because of the possible presence of the negative 
chop beam images on the detector when doing imaging polarimetry.  When the 
registration is requested the pixel offsets are printed to the terminal.  
These offsets should not be large.  Offsets that are significantly more than 
1 pixel in x or in y are probably not correct.
.sp
The formulae used for the transformation are as follows, where the four 
wave-plate images at 0, 22.5, 45, and 67.5 degrees are denoted by I00, I45, 
I90, and I135 respectively:
.sp
.nf
    U = I00 - I90

    Q = I45 - I135

    I = (I00 + I45 + I90 + I135)/2
.fi
.sp
From the I, U and Q images the polarized image (Ip), unpolarized image (Iu), 
polarization fraction (p), and polarization angle (theta) can be calculated 
as follows:
.sp
.nf
    Ip = sqrt(U^2 + Q^2)

    Iu = I - Iu

    p = 100 * I_u/I

    theta = atan(U/Q)
.fi
.sp
all of which are done on a pixel by pixel basis using the IMARITH and 
IMFUNCTION tasks.  The p values are expressed in percent, the theta 
values are given in degrees.
.sp
The output image is a MEF file with seven image extensions, each of dimension 
[320,240].  These are I, U, Q, Iu, Ip, p, and theta respectively.  The primary
image header is taken from the input file.
.sp
If the \fIfl_mask\fR flag is toggle on then before the Ip, p, and theta images 
are generated those pixels which have too low a signal to produce a reliable 
polarization measurement will be masked out.  This is done on the basis of 
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), so first the noise level needs to be defined.  
This is done by taking the standard deviation of pixels in some blank area 
of the field of view.  The \fIblankarea\fR parameter gives the area of the 
image where the sigma value is calculated.  This is done with the I image, 
and applied to the U and Q images before going on with the calculations that 
produce the additional images.  Note, however, that the I, U, and Q images 
that are in the first 3 extensions of the output file are not masked in any 
way.
.sp
To detect any p values above a threshold p_min, given by the \fIthreshold\fR 
parameter (which is a percentage value) the S/N of a pixel must be larger 
than 45.5/sqrt(p_min).  That is, the S/N must be 45.5 or more to reliably 
detect p values of 1% or more, 184 to reliably detect p values of 0.5% or 
more, and so on.  All pixels that or have S/N too low to give a reliable 
percent polarization of at least the \fIthreshold\fR value are set to zero.  If
\fIfl_negative\fR=no, then the negative pixels will also be set to zero.

EXAMPLE
1. Calculate the Stokes parameters. Do not use the low signal-to-noise pixels 
nor the negative pixels.  Also, register the individual wave-plate position 
images.
