NAME
miclean -- Remove pattern noise from Michelle or T-ReCS images
.ih
USAGE
miclean inimages 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The name of an image, an image list, or a wildcard image name, for which 
the cleaning is to be done.  These will usually be stacked images produced 
by MPREPARE or TPREPARE.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
An optional path name where the input files are located.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The names of the output cleaned images.  If the names are defined, the 
number of output images must equal the number of input images.  This 
option supersedes the \fIoutpref\fR option.
.le
.ls outpref = "c"
A prefix to the input file names to generate the output file names.  Used only 
if \fIoutimages\fR is blank.
.le
.ls fl_stair = yes
Remove the channel-to-channel "staircase" offsets from the image.  This is 
done before any row or column pattern noise cleaning.  The T-ReCS and Michelle 
arrays have 16 read channels each 20 columns wide, which may have small 
offsets with respect to each other.  The "staircase" option attempts to 
remove these offsets.
.le
.ls fl_columns = no
Remove the vertical "noise" signal in the image.  Only one of 
\fIfl_columns\fR and \fIfl_rows\fR can be set to "yes" in a given call to 
this routine.
.le
.ls fl_rows = no
Remove the horizontal "noise" signal in the image. Only one of 
\fIfl_columns\fR and \fIfl_rows\fR can be set to "yes" in a given call to 
this routine.
.le
.ls fl_simage = no
Create an image of the "staircase" offsets.   If this option is chosen, an 
additional output file is made for each input file showing the "staircase" 
offsets that have been subtracted off of the input image to make the output 
image.  The "staircase" image file name is made by prefixing the 
\fIstairpref\fR to each input image name.
.le
.ls stairpref = "s"
Prefix to each input file name to generate the name of the "staircase" image.
Used only if the \fIfl_simage\fR flag is set to "yes".
.le
.ls fl_nimage = no
Create an image of the horizontal or vertical noise model that is removed 
from the input image.  If this option is chosen, an additional output file is 
made for each input file showing the noise value that have been subtracted off 
from the input image to make the output image.  The noise image file name is 
made by prefixing the \fInoisepref\fR to each input image name.  
.le
.ls noisepref = "n"
Prefix to each input file name to generate the name of the "noise" image.  
Used only if the \fIfl_nimage\fR flag is set to "yes".
.le
.ls threshold = 3.0
Mask off pixels with values deviating from the mean by more than
\fIthreshold\fR times the standard deviation.  The statistics are calculated
using the whole image and before any processing.  The values are masked to
zero.  If the \fIthreshold\fR value is less than 2, then NO masking is done.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile defined
by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error.  This 
parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task is designed to remove certain types of undesirable low-level 
structure from T-ReCS or Michelle images.  It can remove the small channel 
to channel offsets, called "staircasing", often observed in Michelle or 
T-ReCS images, as well as certain types of pattern noise that are sometimes 
seen in the images.  There is sometimes a low level horizontal signal pattern 
in the images which is fairly uniform from left to right on the array, or 
an analogous vertical pattern signal going up and down the columns.  These 
pattern signal can be removed by this routine provided the source 
is small on the array.  This routine will NOT work very well in those cases 
where there is signal over a large fraction of the array, as it assumes that 
over the entire array most of the area is detecting residual sky background 
plus the pattern noise signals to be removed.
.sp
For each input file a "cleaned" output file is produced.  The name of the 
output files are either specified in the \fIoutimages\fR parameter or defined 
by prefixing the \fIoutpref\fR string to each input file name.  The task will 
exit if either any of the specified input files does not exist or if any of 
the specified output files already exists.
.sp
In order to remove these various structured signals from the input image, 
median values are found for different subsets of the image (using the 
IMSTATISTICS task) and subtracted off to produce the output image.  
For the "staircase" offsets the region used for the calculation of the 
median is each 20 by 240 pixel channel.  These are image sections [1:20,*], 
[21:40,*], etc to [301:320,*] for a stacked Michelle or T-ReCS image of 
dimension [320,240].  The 16 median values are calculated and then these 
are subtracted off of each section.  In those channels where the source 
is located, or where a negative source image is located, the median will 
not as accurately represent the background value compared to channels where 
there is no signal and only residual noise from the chopping and nodding.  
This is why the task will fail if the source is too large in the field, as 
the median values for many of the channels will be determined by the source 
signal rather than the residual channel responses.
.sp
The staircase noise is removed if the \fIfl_stair\fR flag is set to "yes".  
If the \fIfl_simage\fR flag is set to "yes" then an additional output file 
will be produced for each input file that shows the staircase values that have 
been subtracted off of the input image.  A check is made as to whether any 
of these output files already exist, and if any do the task exits with an 
error state.
.sp
In a similar way, either vertical or horizontal pattern noise can be removed 
from the input images if the \fIfl_column\fR or \fIfl_row\fR flags are set. 
The task is written to do only one of these two options in a single call 
(the staircasing option can co-exist with either of these options, in which 
case it is done first).  If the \fIfl_row\fR option is chosen then the 
median of each row is found and subtracted from that row.  If the 
\fIfl_column\fR option is chosen the median of each column is found and 
subtracted off of the column values.  The effect of this is to produce as 
close to a zero average background as possible.
.sp
For all these methods of cleaning, if the task is applied to a raw data image 
rather than a difference image then the task takes the average value over 
the entire 320 by 240 image and makes all the offsets relative to this value.  
Otherwise the base sky level will be completely lost in the cleaning process, 
which leads to very odd looking images.  The relative shifts from channel to 
channel are preserved in this process.
.sp
Where any of these types of cleaning is requested the \fIthreshold\fR 
value determines whether any signal from an object is masked off before the 
median values are determined for the rows or the columns or the sections.  
If this value is less than 2 no masking is done.  If the value is 2.0 or 
larger then this number of standard deviations above or below the mean is 
taken as the threshold for masking off signal.  Thus if the 
\fIthreshold\fR value is 3.0, for example, all pixels brighter than the 
image mean plus 3.0 times the image standard deviation are masked to 0.0 
and all pixels with values below the image mean minus 3.0 times the image 
standard deviation are masked to 0.0 before the median values for the rows 
or columns are calculated.  This masking will affect the median value that 
is obtained somewhat.  The user of the task needs to judge whether the 
result of masking is good or not.  In general where a target is somewhat 
extended such that it overlaps two or more of the 16 channels the masking 
improves the staircase subtraction.
.sp
As with the case of the staircase cleaning, when the vertical or horizontal 
pattern noise is to be removed it is possible to have the noise images 
written out, one per input image.  This is done if the \fIfl_nimage\fR 
flag is set to "yes".  When this is the case the \fInoisepref\fR string is 
prefixed to each input file name to make the output noise file name.  If 
any of these files already exist the task will exit with an error.
.sp
All of the cleaning functions in this task will fail if the source is too 
large on the array.  In such cases one will be subtracting off some amount of 
real signal.  For a point source or a small extended source the task should 
work well.

EXAMPLES
1. Remove the "staircase" noise and the vertical noise pattern from a Michelle
stacked image.  Create a copy of the staircase and noise patterns that are 
being removed.

.sp
The task will produce output images \fIcrN20051218S0038\fR, 
\fIsrN20051218S0038\fR, and \fInmN20051218S0038\fR containing the cleaned 
image, the staircase offsets, and the (column0 noise pattern respectively.  
The output files are MEF files with the same number of extensions as the 
original image has, one in this case.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
This routine will not work very well in those cases where there is signal over
a large fraction of the array, as it assumes that over the entire array most of
the area is detecting residual sky background plus the pattern noise signals to
be removed.
.sp
The task is mainly designed for usage with the stacked images.  While it can 
be applied to either the raw data files or "prepared" files, in which case the 
process will be applied to each image plane, it is not clear how well this 
works with the raw data images.  Using \fImiclean\fR on the non-stacked 
images would seem to only be useful if one is intending to examine the 
individual nods or savesets in detail.
