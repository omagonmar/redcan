NAME
mstelluric -- Divide science target spectrum by a telluric calibrator 
(calibrator is corrected for blackbody continuum shape). 
.ih
USAGE
mstelluric inimages cal bbody
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input spectra to be processed by the task. It can be an spectrum name, 
a list of spectra names, a wild-card file name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
Michelle or T-ReCS spectroscopy files that have been run through previous
steps of the MIDIR spectroscopy reduction: MIREDUCE, NSWAVELENGTH, 
NSTRANSFORM, and NSEXTRACT.  Note, at the present time the input spectra 
into MSTELLURIC must be extracted in NSEXTRACT, no 2D telluric correction
is currently supported.
.le
.ls cal 
The input calibration spectra to be used by the task to correct out
the telluric features in the target \fIinimages\fR.  This spectral file must be
Michelle or T-ReCS spectroscopy files that have been run through previous
steps of the MIDIR spectroscopy reduction: MIREDUCE, NSWAVELENGTH, 
NSTRANSFORM, and NSEXTRACT.  Note that at the present time this task only
accepts one calibration spectral file - correcting multiple spectral data 
files with multiple calibrators is not currently supported.
.le
.ls bbody  
The blackbody temperature of the calibration object.  This input
is required to correct the continuum shape of the calibrator so that it is
not folded into the output science data when the telluric division is done.
The default value is set to 1.0, the task will prompt the user for a value
if this is not set in the command call.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output spectra name(s) for the reduced files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output spectra exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "a"
A prefix string which is prefixed to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls xcorr = no
Cross-correlate   each   input  spectrum  with  the  calibration 
spectrum to determine the shift  for  the  calibration  spectrum?
Only  regions  specified by the sample regions parameter will be
used in the cross-correlation.  
.le
.ls lag = 10
The cross-correlation lag to use when \fIxcorr\fR = yes.  The  lag  is
given  in  pixels.    This is the distance to either side of the
initial  shift  over  which  the  cross-correlation  profile  is 
computed.    If   a   value   of   zero   is   given   then  the 
cross-correlation step is not done.
.le
.ls shift = 0., dshift = 0.5
The  initial  shift  and shift step in pixels.  This initializes
the \fIshift\fR search parameters for the first spectrum.   If  \fIdshift\fR
is  zero  then  there  will be no search for a new shift and the
'x' interactive function is disabled.  These parameters  may  be
changed  interactively.   After  the  first  spectrum subsequent
spectra begin with the values from the last spectrum.
.le
.ls scale = 1., dscale = 0.1
The  initial  scale  and scale step.  This initializes the \fIscale\fR
search parameters for the first spectrum.   If  \fIdscale\fR  is  zero
then  there  will  be  no  search  for  a  new scale and the 'y'
interactive function  is  disabled.   These  parameters  may  be
changed  interactively.   After  the  first  spectrum subsequent
spectra begin with the values from the last spectrum.
.le
.ls threshold = 0.01
Since  the  calibration  consists  of  division  by  the  scaled 
calibration data it is possible for totally saturated  lines  to
have  zero  or  negative  values.  The task will quit if detects
negative or  zero  calibration  values.   The  threshold  allows
applying  a  minimum  threshold to the calibration values so the
task may continue.
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
A boolean value to toggle on or off the interactive tweaking of the
correction.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task requires input of a science spectrum (or list of spectra),
a telluric calibration star and the blackbody temperature of the calibrator
as the input values.  The task corrects the calibration star spectrum
for the continuum shape of the blackbody, then uses the result to
divide out the telluric atmospheric absorption features in the science 
spectra.  The telluric correction is done using a call to the NOAO onedspec
task TELLURIC. 
.sp
One output file is produced for each input file.  If the number of input 
and output files listed do not match the task exits with an error condition. 
One can have automatically generated output file names by specifying the 
\fIoutpref\fR parameter and NOT specifying the \fIoutimages\fR parameter. 
If neither of these is specified, the \fIoutpref\fR parameter is set to be 
"a".  One cannot overwrite the input file by the output file.
.sp
The routine writes to a \fIlogfile\fR.  If the task logfile name is not 
specified then the routine looks for the MIDIR logfile name.  If the logfile 
exists, any messages are appended to it.  The \fIverbose\fR parameter 
does not effect the logfile, but does change how much information is 
written to the terminal.

EXAMPLES
1. The basic usage is
.sp
.nf
     cl> mstelluric xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 bbody=10400
.fi
.sp
which will produce an output file named "axtrS20031228S0175.fits". (This is 
assuming that there are no errors.)  In this case the original file must be in 
the current directory, and that is where the output file is created.
.sp
2. Using MSTELLURIC for spectra in another directory is done as with 
.sp
.nf
    cl> mstelluric xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 bbody=10400
.fi
.sp
which would read "/home/user/trecs/xtrS20031228S0175.fits" and produce an 
output file named "axtrS20031228S0175.fits" in the current directory if 
all goes well.
.sp
3. Defining the output file name works the following way:
.sp
.nf
    cl> mstelluric xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 bbody=10400 \
    >>> outimages=frame175
.fi
.sp
which should produce "frame75.fits" from "xtrS20031228S0175", 
both files being in the current directory.
.sp
4. If one wants to define the prefix explicitly and apply it to all 
the spectra in a list it is done by
.sp
.nf
    cl> mstelluric xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 bbody=10400 \
    >>> outpref="new" logfile="test.log" verbose=no
.fi
.sp
which produces an output file named "newxtrS20031228S0175.fits" for an 
input file named "xtrS20031228S0175".  In this 
example the logfile name is set to "test.log" and the messages to the 
terminal are kept to a minimum by setting verbose to "no".
.sp
5. To run the routine using a cross correlation in the call to the telluric 
task:
.sp
.nf
    cl> mstelluric xtrS20031228S0175 xtrS20031228S0176 bbody=10400 \
    >>> fl_xcorr+
.fi
.sp
which will do a cross correlation of the science target and the telluric 
standard and determine and apply a shift to the data before the division is 
done.  
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
At the present time, the best output spectrum obtained automatically when 
MSTELLURIC is run with the \fIxcorr\fR parameter set to "no".  However, much 
better cross correlation correction of the telluric features can be obtained if
the task is run interactively with the cross correlation option on.  (i.e.,
with \fIxcorr\fR+ and \fIfl_inter\fR+).
