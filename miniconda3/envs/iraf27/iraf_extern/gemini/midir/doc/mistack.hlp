NAME
mistack -- Performs a straight average of the nod images within a given 
data file
.ih
USAGE
mistack inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
The input image(s) to be processed by the task. It can be an image name, 
a list of image names, a wild-card image name, or the "@" syntax can be 
used to direct the task to read a list of file names.  These all must be 
files that have been made by the TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
The output image name(s) for the registered files.  If this field is left 
blank the \fIoutpref\fR string is used to create new file names from the 
input file names.  Otherwise the number of output file names must match 
the number of input file names or an error condition occurs.  The field 
must contain either a list of output file names or use the "@" syntax to 
direct the task to read a list of file names.  The task tests for whether 
the output images exist and exits with an error condition if any of them 
do exist.
.le
.ls outpref = "s"
A prefix string which is prefixed to each input image name to make
the corresponding output image name if the output file name(s) are 
not specified via the \fIoutimages\fR parameter.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The path to the directory containing the T-ReCS or Michelle image files.  
If the value is "" (empty string) the current directory is used.
.le
.ls frametype = "dif"
A variable to mark which type of images are to be combined: the default is 
"dif" for the difference frames, but it can also be "src" for the on-source 
frames or "ref" for the sky reference frames.
.le
.ls combine = "average"
A variable which can have the values "average" or "sum".  This determines 
whether the combination of images is done via averaging or by summation. 
This variable is passed to the IMCOMBINE task as its \fIcombine\fR 
parameter.  Any value aside from "average" or "sum" produces an error.
.le
.ls fl_variance = no
If this flag is set to "yes" then when the images from the individual nod 
pair images are combined the variance is also calculated and written to the 
output file as a second extension.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task, which may be called as part of the standard reduction pipeline 
in MIREDUCE, takes one or more input midir image files and either averages 
or sums the individual frames from the various nods using the IMCOMBINE task. 
One can choose, with the \fIframetype\fR parameter, to sum any of the 
three image planes of the standard midir file: the on-source images, 
the reference sky images, or the difference images.  The latter is 
the default case.  The resulting output MEF file contains one or two 
extensions depending on the \fIfl_variance\fR flag.  If this flag is 
"no" then the output image has a single extension in which the 
combined frame is stored.  This image has dimension [320,240].  
All input images have equal weight in the averaging or summation.  
If the \fIfl_variance\fR flag is set to "yes" then there is an 
additional second extension in the output file which contains 
the variance image.
.sp
Any NOD images that are marked as BAD using MIBACKGROUND, 
MBACKGROUND, MIVIEW, or TVIEW are omitted from the 
averaging.  It is assumed that at least one frame in the file is good.
.sp
The task will exit with an error if the specified output file already exists 
or if the input file is not the output of TPREPARE or MPREPARE.
It will also fail with a system level error if there are no good frames in 
a given input file.
.sp
If the input file specified has already been either combined (via MISTACK 
or MIREGISTER), then no output file is produced.  In this case a message is 
printed to the logfile but no error is flagged.
.sp 
The \fIcombine\fR parameter is passed to the IMCOMBINE task and 
determines whether the individual nod position images are averaged (the 
default) or summed.  The output images for the two different "combine" 
parameter values are identical except for a factor of 2 times the 
number of nod cycles in the image.
.ih
EXAMPLE
1. Stack a T-ReCS image locate in the directory "/home/user/data":
.sp
.nf
    cl> mistack tS20030916S0101 rawpath="/home/user/data"
.fi
.sp
This command would look in directory "/home/user/data" for input file, which 
would have been previously produced using TPREPARE.  It will produce an
output file named "stS20030916S0101" in the current directory.  All the 
difference images in the original file that are not flagged as "BAD" 
in the header are averaged with IMCOMBINE using weight of 1 and 
no rejection of frames.
