NAME
miflat -- Derive flat field and bad pixel mask for MID-IR images
.ih
USAGE
miflat inimage1 inimage2 outimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage1 = ""
The name of a T-ReCS or Michelle STARE mode image file to be used to make 
the flat field frame.  Unlike most of the tasks in the \fImidir\fR package, 
lists of files, wild-card file names, or lists (the "@" syntax) cannot be 
used for the file specifications for this task.
.le
.ls inimage2 = ""
The name of a second T-ReCS or Michelle STARE mode image file to be used to 
make the flat field frame.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The optional path to where the input images are found.  If blank the 
input images are assumed to be in the current directory.
.le
.ls outimage = ""
The name for the output flat field image.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by midir.logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an error. 
This parameter is always set by the task, and should not be modified by 
the user.

DESCRIPTION
This task is used to combine two T-ReCS or Michelle stare mode images into 
a flat field frame.  The images to be used must be the output files from the 
TPREPARE or MPREPARE tasks.  Also the files must be from the same 
instrument.  What is done is to take the two average frames from the 
observations, subtract the one with lower signal from the one with higher 
signal, and divide the resulting image by its median pixel value.  The file 
that results is stored in the output MEF file.  This file can then be used in 
the MIREDUCE procedure.
.sp
Both input images must be taken in STARE mode.
.sp
The task makes some checks on the input files, but it is up to the user to 
insure that these files are of the same exposure time, are in the same filter, 
and so on.  The user needs to examine the resulting output file to insure that 
it is suitable for flat fielding.  Such checks cannot be made automatically in 
the procedure to cover all possible cases.
.sp
The task works on one pair of input images at a time, and produces a single 
output image.  The task does not accept lists of images for the input or 
output images.
.sp
One can specify a path to the input images using the \fIrawpath\fR parameter. 
The output file is created in the current directory.
.ih
EXAMPLE
1. Create a flatfield, flatsi1, from two input images located in the directory
/home/user/data:

.nf
    cl> miflat rS20030916S0010 rS20030916S0011 flatsi1 \
    >>> rawpath="/home/user/data"
.fi

This command would look in directory "/home/user/data" for two files, which 
would have been previously produced using MIREDUCE with the flatfielding 
option, \fIfl_flat\fR, set to "no".  These files would have to be created with 
the \fIstackoption\fR parameter set to "stack".  The original observations 
would normally have been carried out in stare mode.
.sp
The two files would be copied to temporary images in the current directory, 
then the task will determine which one of them has the larger median value, 
and on this basis decide with image is to be subtracted from the other.  The 
difference image will then be divided by its median value to produce the 
output image "flatsi1".
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
This routine has not been tested with any Michelle flat field observations, 
and only for one attempted flat field observation with T-ReCS.
