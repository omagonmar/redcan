NAME
msflatcor -- Apply bias subtraction and flat fielding to a Michelle image
.ih
USAGE
msflatcor inimage flat bias 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage
This is the name of a Michelle image file.  It is intended that the 
flat fielding and bias subtraction are applied to a raw image, but it can 
be done for a prepared or stacked Michelle image as well.  Only a single 
input file name can be used here, not lists or wildcard expressions.
.le
.ls flat
This is the name of a Michelle flat image, which is assumed here to be 
taken in stare mode.  Thus the file should have a single extension of 
dimension [320,240,1,1].  Only a single input file name can be used here, 
not lists or wildcard expressions.
.le
.ls bias
This is the name of a Michelle bias image, which is assumed here to be 
taken in stare mode.  Thus the file should have a single extension of 
dimension [320,240,1,1].  It is used only if \fIfl_bias\fR is "yes".
Only a single input file name can be used here, not lists or wildcard 
expressions.
.le
.ls outimage = ""
A optional output file name for the corrected image.  If blank, the output 
file name is formed from the input file name and the \fIoutpref\fR parameter.
.le
.ls outpref = "f"
A string to prefix to the input file name to make the output file name, 
if the \fIoutimage\fR parameter is blank.  Otherwise it is ignored.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The directory path for the flat, bias, and input images.  If the images are 
in the current directory, this should be set to "".  Since the images are 
usually raw images taken together during the observations, they are assumed 
to be in the same directory.
.le
.ls fl_bias = yes
A boolean variable which determines whether bias subtraction will be carried 
out or not.  If the value is "no", then the \fIbias\fR is ignored.  In 
any case bias subtraction is not carried out for chopped mode observations, 
since it should subtract out in the difference frames.
.le
.ls fl_writeflat = no
A boolean flag for whether to write out the normalized flat-field image or 
not.  If this value is "no", the \fInormflat\fR parameter is ignored.
.le
.ls normflat = ""
The name for an output image containing the normalized flat-field image.  
If no name is given the routine will use "normflat" as the default.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
An output status flag.  For successful execution the value is returned as 
zero, otherwise it is set to 1.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This routine applies bias and flat-field corrections to a Michelle image.  
The bias and flat-field observations are assumed to be taken in stare mode 
for spectroscopic observations, and to be taken at the same time as the 
input image.  The input image can be a spectrum taken in either the low 
resolution mode or in the higher resolution modes.  In the case of low 
resolution spectroscopy, which is assumed to be taken in chop-nod mode, 
the bias correction will not be applied since it is removed in the formation 
of the difference images.  These observations can still be flat-fielded,
since that correction applies to the difference image in the same way as 
to the images in the two chop positions.  All the input files are assumed 
to be multi-extension fits files.
.sp
Both the flat field image and the bias image, if used, are assumed to be 
of dimension [320,240,1,1] and be found in extension 1 of the file.  These 
images are used in the IMARITH routine to carry out the operations.  
A check is explicitly made that the first two image dimensions are 320 and 
240 respectively.
.sp
If the \fIfl_bias\fR value is "yes" then the bias image is subtracted from 
each extension of the input image when that image is determined to be 
taken in NOD-only or STARE modes.  The \fIfl_bias\fR flag is overridden if 
the third image dimension in an extension of the input image is any value 
other than 1, in which case no bias subtraction is carried out in the 
input image.
.sp
When bias subtraction is requested it is also applied to the flat-field 
image.
.sp
The flat field image is normalized inside the routine to give a mean value 
of 1 over the image.  For Michelle spectra taken in the higher resolution 
modes the illuminated area of the detector is smaller than the full frame.  
The routine attempts to locate these boundaries and exclude pixels outside 
them from the calculation of the normalization value.  These regions are 
screened out and replaced with a value of 1.0 in the normalized flat-field 
image.  Spectra taken in low resolution mode generally have no such 
unilluminated region on the detector, in which case the entire image is 
used for the normalization.  A simple average value over the illuminated 
region of the detector is found using IMSTAT and the original image 
is divided by this value.
.sp
If the range of values in this flat field image is too large, the task 
then carries out a fit of the flat image to try to remove the spectral 
shape of the blackbody function.  This is an issue only for the low resolution
modes.  In the higher resolution modes, especially for the echelle, the 
variation of the blackbody function over the image is relatively small and 
surface fitting is not required.  In these modes the fringing in the image 
generally makes fitting the image difficult, and thus the simpler method is
used to generate the flat field image.  There will be some large-scale 
structure in the flat field due to the fringes and the blackbody function, 
but it assumed that these can be calibrated out when the object spectrum 
is ratioed to the standard spectrum, since they affect both images in 
exactly the same manner.
.sp
When fitting needs to be done, the IMSURFIT task is used.  The 
fit uses the illuminated sections of the array.  Legendre polynomials 
are used, with order 10 in x and y plus cross-terms.
.sp
If the \fIfl_writeflat\fR flag is set to "yes" then the  resulting 
flat field image is written out to a file specified by the \fInormflat\fR 
parameter.  If this file already exists the routine will exit with an error.
.sp
The output file is generated by subtracting the bias value from each image 
extension, if \fIfl_bias\fR is "yes" and the observing mode is NOD rather than 
CHOP or CHOP-NOD, and then dividing by the normalized flat-field image.  The 
output file has the same number of extensions as the input file does.  
A check is made of the first two dimensions of the images in each extension.  
If these values are not [320,240] the routine exits with an error condition.
.sp
The image manipulation is done using the IMARITH routine.

EXAMPLE
1.  The following shows the default usage of MSFLATCOR to flat field a 
raw low resolution N-band spectral observation.  All the files are 
in the current directory.  The normalized flat field image is saved 
in "flat118" for later examination.  The flat field is good over most 
of the image but it does poorly in columns 1 to 12 because the input 
blackbody spectrum is falling steeply at these short wavelengths.  
Generally these wavelengths are completely blocked by the atmosphere so 
this should not affect the resulting spectrum.  The statistics in the 
region [13:320,*] are good, so the flat field is usable.  In this case 
no output name is given so the prefix "f" is used to make the output file 
name.  The output file is fN20051217S0117.fits.
.sp
Rows 228 to 240 were not illuminated and were masked out so that they 
have a value near 1.0 in the normalized flat.
