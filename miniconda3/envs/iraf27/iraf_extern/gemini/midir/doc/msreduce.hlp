NAME
msreduce -- Pipeline routine for Mid-IR spectral reductions
USAGE 
msreduce inspec
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inspec
The name of Michelle or T-ReCS spectral raw image(s).
.le
.ls outtype = "fnu"
Key for what type of flux units one wants in the output spectrum: one can 
specify "fnu" to get frequency flux density values in Jy, "flambda" to get 
wavelength flux density in Watts/meter squared per micron, or "lambdaFlmabda" 
to get values in Watts/meter-squared.  This is used only if the \fIfl_std\fR
flag is "yes" and \fIfl_bbody\fR flag is "no".
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
The directory path for the image(s).  If the image or images are in the 
current directory, this should be set to "".
.le
.ls line = 160
The column number for the center of the region which is extracted and used to 
identify the aperture for the spectrum.  The default is 160, the array center.
.le
.ls fl_std = no
This is a flag for whether both source and standard star spectra are 
extracted.  If it is "no", the source spectrum is wavelength calibrated 
and extracted giving a raw spectrum in counts uncorrected for atmospheric
effect.  If it is "yes" then for each source spectrum a standard star spectrum
is also reduced, and the telluric correction (plus possibly a 
spectrophotometric calibration) is carried out.
.le
.ls std = ""
The name of Michelle or T-ReCS standard star spectral raw image(s).  This 
is not used if the \fIfl_std\fR is "no".
.le
.ls stdname = "" 
This is the name of the standard star.  It is used in querying for the 
absolute spectrum of the standard in the mid-infrared.  This is used only if 
\fIfl_std\fR is "yes" and \fIfl_bbody\fR is "no".  The name is passed to the 
MSABSFLUX routine.
.le
.ls fl_bbody = no 
This is a flag for whether the standard star spectrum will be approximated
by a normalized blackbody function.  It is ignored if \fIfl_std\fR is 
"no".  If \fIfl_std\fR is "yes" and this parameter is "yes" then the 
\fIbbody\fR parameter is used to set the continuum shape for the standard 
star spectrum in a call to MSTELLURIC.  If \fIfl_std\fR is "yes" 
and this parameter is "no" then the MSABSFLUX routine is called, and 
actual spectrophotometric data for the standard is used for calibration.
.le
.ls bbody = 10000.0
When \fIfl_std\fR is "yes" and \fIfl_bbody\fR is "yes" this value is 
taken as the colour temperature of the standard star in the mid-infrared. 
Otherwise it is ignored.  The value is passed to MSTELLURIC.
.le
.ls fl_flat = no
A flag for whether the raw image is bias subtracted and flat fielded 
before other steps in the processing.  If this value is "yes" then the 
\fIflat\fR and \fIbias\fR parameters must give the names of the flat-field
and bias images.
.le
.ls flat = ""
When \fIfl_flat\fR is "yes" this is the name of the flat-field images(s) 
to be used with the source and standard star image(s).  Otherwise it is 
ignored.  There must be one flat-field image for each source image.
.le
.ls bias = ""
When \fIfl_flat\fR is "yes" this is the name of the bias images(s) 
to be used with the source and standard star image(s).  Otherwise it is 
ignored.  There must be one bias image for each source image.
.le
.ls fl_extract = no
A boolean value indicating whether to run NSEXTRACT in interactive mode.
.le
.ls fl_telluric = no
A boolean value indicating whether to run MSTELLURIC in interactive mode.
.le
.ls fl_wavelength = no
A boolean value indicating whether to run NSWAVELENGTH in interactive mode.
.le
.ls fl_fitcoords = no
A boolean value indicating whether to run NSFITCOORDS in interactive mode.
.le
.ls fl_retrace = no
A boolean value indicating whether to retrace the spectrum in the processing, 
if one has done a reduction previously.
.le
.ls fl_process = yes
A boolean value indicating whether to run MIREDUCE before going on to 
the subsequent steps in the processing.
.le
.ls fl_clear = yes
A boolean value indicating whether to clear the "database" directory, and
thereby lose all previous processing information, before starting the 
reductions.
.le
.ls fl_negative = no
A boolean value indicating whether to try to extract a negative spectrum from 
the images or not; this is necessary for spectra taken in pure NOD mode.  It 
will not work for CHOP-NOD mode observations.  Higher resolution Michelle 
spectra are usually taken in pure NOD mode.  All T-ReCS spectra and low 
resolution Michelle spectra are taken in regular CHOP-NOD mode.
.le
.ls fl_defringe = yes
A boolean value indicating whether to defringe the extracted spectrum with 
the MSDEFRINGE task.  The defringing routine is intrinsically interactive 
because the period of the fringes in a spectrum is a function of the 
resolution, the wavelength, and the slit width.  No generic automatic 
defringing algorithm has been found, it must be done by hand.
.le
.ls fl_lowres = yes
A boolean value for whether the spectrum is in low resolution mode or not; 
this is used only for MSDEFRINGE, so it does not matter if 
\fIfl_defringe\fR is set to "no".  This is passed to MSDEFRINGE
.le
.ls fl_skybiassub = no
A boolean value for whether the bias frame is subtracted off the sky frames 
used for wavelength calibration. 
.le
.ls fmin = 18
This value is passed to MSDEFRINGE.  When \fIfl_lowres\fR is "no" 
this determines the initial minimum frequency to screen out.
.le
.ls fmax = 32
This value is passed to MSDEFRINGE.  When \fIfl_lowres\fR is "no" 
this determines the initial maximum frequency to screen out.
.le
.ls fl_dfinterp = yes
This value is passed to MSDEFRINGE as the \fImsdefringe.fl_interpolate\fR 
flag, determining whether the screened frequency components are set to zero
or whether a linear interpolation from the adjacent frequency bins is carried
out.
.le
.ls fl_zerocut = yes
This parameter is passed to MSDEFRINGE, and determines whether any negative 
values in the input spectrum are masked to zero or not.
.le
.ls fl_reextract = no
A boolean value indicating whether to just re-extract the spectra; if this 
is "yes" than it will be assumed that the wavelength calibrated raw spectra 
are present to work with, and only MSABSFLUX/MSTELLURIC will be called in the 
processing for each pair of files.
.le
.ls linelist = ""
The name for the line list file to be used in identification of the atmospheric
lines.  If this is blank, the default file "gnirs$data/sky.dat" is used; that
file is intended for low resolution spectra only.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile. The default value makes the task use the logfile
defined by \fImidir.logfile\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
An output status flag.  For successful execution the value is returned as 
zero, otherwise it is set to 1.
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This is a wrapper routine which calls the spectroscopic reduction tasks in the 
GNIRS package, and some tasks in the MIDIR package, to carry 
out the processing of either individual source spectra or pairs of source 
and standard spectra taken with Michelle or T-ReCS.  If only source spectra 
are being processed the result is a wavelength calibrated raw spectrum in 
counts, with no telluric corrections or absolute calibration.  The more 
usual option is to reduce pairs of spectra, one from the source and one from 
a standard star, to produce output source spectra which has been wavelength 
calibrated, corrected for the telluric features, and which has the correct 
shape.  The output spectrum will either have the correct relative shape but 
not absolute brightness information (if the MSTELLURIC routine is used) 
or will be absolutely calibrated subject to the uncertainties of correcting 
for the slit losses (if the MSABSFLUX routine is used).  Which method is 
used depends upon the \fIfl_std\fR flag and the \fIfl_bbody\fR flag.
.sp
Various steps in the process can be executed with some type of interactive 
input.  Many of the flags, such as \fIfl_extract\fR, allow one to control which
steps are run interactively.  It is not generally a good idea to run everything
without interactive input, since the wavelength calibration may come out 
wrong when this is done.  For a stellar target the extraction and tracing 
may work properly in automatic mode, but this also is not certain.  The 
defringing cannot be done automatically.  If that option is to be used, that 
step at least must be interactive.
.sp
The steps of the processing are as follows:
.ls
(0) Run NSHEADERS to configure the spectroscopy routine to Michelle or T-ReCs
data.
.le
.ls
.sp
(1) Each input file is checked and the instrument name, Michelle or T-ReCS, 
is determined.  Any other instrument name or a failure 
to determine the name causes the file to be skipped in the processing.
.le
.ls
.sp
(2) If the \fIfl_flat\fR flag is set to "yes" then each input file has the 
bias subtraction and flat fielding carried out via a call to the MSFLATCOR 
routine.  The output of this then has an "f" prefixed to the original file 
name.  This is done for all the raw data files, whether of a source or of a 
standard.
.le
.ls
.sp
(3) If \fIfl_process\fR is "yes" then MIREDUCE is run on the files to 
extract the stacked difference and sky reference images.  These 
output files have prefixes "r" and "a" respectively.  If files that match 
these output file names, or the name of the "prepared" file, are already 
in the current directory they are replaced by new files.
.le
.ls
.sp
(4) The routine NSWAVELENGTH is run to identify the sky lines in the sky
image.  The output file has prefix "wa".  The sky lines are identified at 
different positions along the slit.  If the output file already exists, 
it is replaced. It is possible to subtract a bias frame off the sky frames used
for wavelength calibration. This can help greatly with the ease of identifying 
the emission lines.
.le
.ls
.sp
(5) The routines NSFITCOORDS and NSTRANSFORM are run to apply the wavelength 
solution to the difference image.  The output file has prefix "tfr".  If a file
of that name is present it is replaced.
.le
.ls
.sp
(6) The routine NSEXTRACT is run to extract the target spectrum.  When 
the spectrum is extracted the prefix is "xtr", and any existing file is 
replaced.
.le
.ls
.sp
(7) If the \fIfl_defringe\fR value is "yes", the spectrum is defringed using 
the MSDEFRINGE routine.  If this is successful the defringed spectrum is given 
the prefix "dxtr".
.le
.sp
These steps are carried out for both the object spectrum and the standard 
star spectrum when \fIfl_std\fR is "yes".  If this flag is "no" then 
these steps are done only for the specified source spectra, and the task 
ends after this step.
.le
.ls
.sp
(8) Finally, either MSABSFLUX or MSTELLURIC is called with the two extracted 
spectra (the "xtr" or "dxtr" files).  The object spectrum is ratioed 
with that of the standard star with a possible small shift to best remove 
the telluric features, and then the ratio spectrum is multiplied by either 
the spectrophotometric values for the given standard star (if MSABSFLUX is 
used) or by a normalized blackbody function of the temperature given by the 
\fIbbody\fR parameter (if MSTELLURIC is used).  Which option is used
depends on the \fIfl_bbody\fR parameter.  

If the spectrophotometry for a standard is to be used, the name of the 
standard needs to be specified in the \fIstdname\fR parameter.  The standards 
are nearly all listed under their HD number, so a name such as "HD197192" 
would be recognized.  For some of the brightest standards names similar to 
"alphaCMa" are used.  In the midir$data directory the file "standards.list" 
gives the names of all the standards for which the spectral energy distribution
values are tabulated.  The files are in the "STANDARD STAR CALIBRATION FILES" 
format used by routines such as SENSFUNC in the NOAO ONEDSPEC package. 
The help for SENSFUNC describes the format of these files.

A special case is if the \fIstdname\fR is given as "asteroid".  In that case 
a template asteroid spectral energy distribution file is used for the standard 
spectrum.  This template is a blackbody fit to the Infrared Space Observatory 
SWS-06 and PHT-40 spectra of Ceres, scaled to the case of an asteroid radius 
of 100 km seen at exactly 1 AU.  The values in the file are for a blackbody 
of temperature 217.05 K.  This file provides an approximate template for 
any large main-belt asteroid which used for spectral calibration.  However 
it should be remembered that there is some variation in temperature for 
different asteroids, and that there is also a variation in mid-infrared 
emissivity with wavelength from asteroid to asteroid.  A really accurate 
calibration using an asteroid requires a detailed physical model of the 
thermal emission, which is beyond the scope of this package.

When MSABSFLUX is used, if the slit losses are the same for the object 
and the standard star, the output spectrum will have the correct 
absolute level and shape.  If not the shape will be correct but the 
level will be wrong by some unknown factor.  The output file has prefix 
"axtr" or "adxtr", and replaces any file of this name already in the directory.

When MSTELLURIC is used all absolute level information is removed from 
the standard star spectrum in the reduction.  The output spectrum will have 
the correct shape provided the standard star has a spectral shape matching 
the defined blackbody temperature over the spectral region.  This temperature 
is given by the \fIbbody\fR parameter.  In the mid-infrared a value of 
10000.0 K will usually be accurate enough for stars of spectral type K and 
earlier.  Note that this is the mid-infrared colour temperature and it need 
not be the same as the stellar effective temperature.  For K-type standard 
stars it is known that the continuum shape is not well approximated by a 
blackbody in the 8 to 13 micron wavelength range due to an SiO molecular 
band.  Thus, the blackbody approximation should only be used for stars 
that are of earlier spectral type.  This option should also not be used 
for stars of spectral types F or later with the higher resolution 
spectral modes of T-ReCS or Michelle.
.le
.sp
Once the spectrum has been extracted, it is displayed with SPLOT for 
the user to look at.
.sp
In the description above, when it is stated that files may be replaced it 
assumes that the operations will be successful.  Any existing output files 
are deleted before the various tasks are run.
