USAGE

PARAMETERS
.ls example (calibration|telluric|science)
The example to display.  These are identified by the type of data that is 
being reduced.  For a given dataset, a calibration reduction must be run 
before either the telluric or science reduction can be finished.  In order to 
telluric correct the science data, the telluric reduction must have been run 
through it's entirety.  The calibration example script includes notes and hints
on how to run the reduction for different wavelength settings.  Reduction of 
telluric and science data is similar for different wavelength regimes.  See 
the NIFSINFO help file for descriptions on each task and a step-by-step 
narrative example of a data NIFS reduction.
