NAME
nffixbad -- Use the PROTO.FIXPIX routine to fix residual bad pixels in NIFS 
            frames
.ih
USAGE
nffixbad inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages 
The input NIFS images to have their bad pixels fixed.  \fIinimages\fR may be 
given as a comma separated list, a @filelist or using wildcards.  Note that 
NFFIXBAD only works on NIFS frames that have been processed to have variance 
and data quality frames.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
A list of output image names.  This list must contain as many names as appear 
in \fIinimages\fR.  If this parameter is empty then an \fIoutprefix\fR is used 
instead.
.le
.ls outpref = "b"
The prefix assigned to output images if the \fIoutimages\fR are not defined.
.le
.ls sci_ext = "SCI"
The EXTNAME for the NIFS science extension in the input file.
.le
.ls var_ext = "VAR"
The EXTNAME for the NIFS variance extension in the input file.
.le
.ls dq_ext = "DQ"
The EXTNAME for the NIFS data quality extension in the input file.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
The name of the logfile.  The default value makes the task use the file name
defined by \fInifs.logfile\fR, or "nifs.log" if that is also not defined.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print verbose actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if NFFIXBAD halted with an error.  This 
parameter is always set by the task and should not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
In this task, the pixels flagged as being bad in the NIFS data quality plane 
are replaced using the default parameters in the PROTO.FIXPIX routine.  To edit
the pixel replacement parameters see also the help and information in the
PROTO.FIXPIX routine.
