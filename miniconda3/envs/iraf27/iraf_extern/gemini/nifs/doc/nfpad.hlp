NAME
nfpad -- Pad NIFS frames in the y-dimension for overfilling of the detector.
.ih
USAGE
nfpad inimage outimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage  
Raw or processed NIFS image to be padded in the y dimension. NFPAD is a simple 
routine which expects only a single input file in either non-MEF or MEF format. 
MEF files should have either 1 extension (SCI, VAR or DQ) or 3 (SCI, VAR and 
DQ).
.le
.ls outimage
The output image from NFPAD.  This routine requires an output file name; 
automatic output prefixes are *not* supported at this time.
.le
.ls exttype = "SCI"
The EXTTYPE keyword which defines the type of frame to be padded, either SCI, 
VAR or DQ.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
The name of the logfile to be written to.  If left empty, "nifs.log" will be
used.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print verbose output to screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if NFPAD halted with an error.  This 
parameter is always set by the task and should not be modified by the user.

DESCRIPTION
Because the lower and upper slices of the NIFS IFU data pattern extend slightly 
beyond the field of the detector at the focal plane, the data images must be 
"padded" in the y-direction to account for this.  This is done so that 
extracting out the slices of the data, processing through the NIFS data 
reduction, and reconstruction into a 3-D data cube goes more smoothly.  NFPAD 
is not meant to be a stand-alone task used from a command line prompt, it is 
called by several of the NIFS-specific tasks in the NIFS data reduction tree.

EXAMPLES
1.  "Pad" a NIFS dataset, and name output image "imgout".
