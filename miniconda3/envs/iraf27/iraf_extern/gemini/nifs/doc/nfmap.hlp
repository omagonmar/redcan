NAME
nfmap -- Extract a channel map from a NIFS data cube
.ih
USAGE
nfmap inimage wavelength npix
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage
The name of a processed NIFS data cube image, which must be the output of 
NFCUBE.  This is assumed to be a MEF file.  Only 1 file can be processed 
at a time.
.le
.ls wavelength = 0.0
The central wavelength of the region to be extracted for the map.  The value 
must be given in Angstroms.  Normally this would be the wavelength of a 
spectral line.
.le
.ls npix = 9
The number of pixels about the specified wavelength to be extracted.  If an 
even number of pixels is specified it is rounded up so the extraction region 
is symmetric about the pixel nearest to the specified wavelength.
.le
.ls velocity = 0.0
A velocity offset value for the region to be used to make the map.  This 
value is given in km/second.  The total shift must be less than 100 pixels 
from the line center.
.le
.ls outimage = ""
If given, this is the output file name.  Otherwise the output file name is 
formed from the \fIoutpref\fR parameter and the input file name.
.le
.ls outpref = "m"
If the \fIoutimage\fR parameter is blank, this prefix is added to the input 
file name to create the output file name.
.le
.ls fl_cont = yes
A flag for whether to subtract off a continuum image.  If the value is yes 
then the CONT1 and CONT2 parameters define adjacent regions (relative to the 
line center) which are used to create a continuum map.
.le
.ls cont1 = "-5:-8"
This string gives one range of values relative to the line center that is to 
be used for making a continuum map.  Regions on each side of the line center 
must be defined. The images for the two regions are either averaged or 
interpolated (depending on the \fIfl_interp\fR flag value) to make a continuum 
image.
.le
.ls cont2 = "5:8"
This string gives a second range of values relative to the line center that 
is to be used for making a continuum map.  Regions on each side of the line 
center must be defined. The images for the two regions are either averaged or 
interpolated (depending on the \fIfl_interp\fR flag value) to make a continuum
image.
.le
.ls fl_interp = no
A flag for whether to make a continuum map from adjacent pixels to then 
subtract off of the map made with the pixels specified by \fIwavelength\fR and 
\fInpix\fR.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of the logfile for the task.  If it is blank, the NIFS package
\fIlogfile\fR name is used.  If that too is not defined, "nifs.log" is used.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
A flag for whether more verbose messages should be written to the terminal.
.le
.ls status = 0
A exit status value, which is zero for a successful completion and some 
positive value if there is a error.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task extracts images from a NIFS data cube, assumed to be produced by 
the NFCUBE routine, for a specified wavelength range.  The motivation for this 
routine is to be able to make emission line maps from NIFS datacubes.  The 
user has the option of simply extracting an image for one or more spectral 
pixels at a certain derived wavelength or to extract a "continuum" image 
from wavelength pixels adjacent to the specified wavelength range and subtract 
this off of the image from the "line" image.  In the case of a velocity 
resolved spectral line it is also possible to specify a velocity shift of 
the "line" region with respect to the given wavelength.
.sp
The task uses the wavelength parameters written to the header by the NFCUBE 
routine to transform from wavelength to pixel number.  The spectra are assumed 
to be linearized to a common linear wavelength scale.  The wavelength that 
is used as input for the task is the same as one would find plotting one of 
the individual spectra in the data cube with SPLOT.
.sp
The "line" region is specified by a central wavelength in Angstroms and a 
window size in pixels.  The window size, specified by \fInpix\fR, should be an 
odd number.  If \fInpix\fR is not an odd number, the value is incremented to 
make it odd.  From the wavelength given and the header parameters the task 
finds the nearest pixel to the specified wavelength.  This is taken as a 
"base" pixel value.  If a \fIvelocity\fR value is specified the central 
wavelength is shifted according to the Doppler formula to obtain the target 
wavelength, rather than just using the input \fIwavelength\fR value.  Once the 
base pixel has been found, all values thereafter are calculated relative to 
this pixel.
.sp
Given an odd value \fInpix\fR the pixel range used for making the image is 
taken to go from -(\fInpix\fR-1)/2 to +(\fInpix\fR-1)/2 with respect to the 
base pixel.  The spectrum pixels for this range in each spacial pixel are 
averaged together to form a two-dimensional image, normally of dimension 
[65,69].
.sp 
If the \fIfl_cont\fR flag is set to yes then a second image is made using 
adjacent spectral pixels above and below the base pixel.  These ranges are 
determined by the \fIcont1\fR and \fIcont2\fR parameters.  The task checks to 
make sure that the adjacent spectral region defined by these parameters does 
not overlap with the region used to make the line map.  Both maps are averaged 
so that the number of spectral pixels in the continuum regions can be anything 
that is needed.  The default action is to simply average over all the spectral 
pixels defined by the \fIcont1\fR and \fIcont2\fR strings.  However there is 
also the option of interpolating between the \fIcont1\fR and \fIcont2\fR 
regions to form the continuum map, which is to be used if the continuum slope 
is significant around where a spectral line is located.  In that case two 
continuum images are formed, one for the pixel range specified by \fIcont1\fR 
and one for that specified by \fIcont2\fR.  Then a weighted average of the two 
images is made, with the weight value depending on how far the center of the 
spectral region is from the base pixel.
.sp
It is assumed that \fIcont1\fR and \fIcont2\fR strings define one region at 
longer wavelength than the line wavelength and a second region at shorter 
wavelength than the line wavelength.
.sp
The output file contains a single MEF extension holding the output 
two-dimensional image.
.sp
The task shows a plot of the collapsed spectrum with the central line region 
marked.  This plot also shows the two continuum regions as well if that 
option is being used.  Each region is marked by a bar.  The bar indicating 
the line region is plotted at a y level near the maximum of the values in 
the plot, while the two bars for the continuum regions (if these are plotted) 
are at a lower y value.
.sp
Channel maps can be obtained by setting \fInpix\fR to 1 and taking different 
velocity values.  As the line wavelength will not generally be exactly at 
an integer pixel value, users need to see from the logfile which spectral 
pixel is being extracted.  A small amount of trial and error may be needed 
for this purpose.  The task prints out the equivalent velocity value for the 
pixel spacing that it is using.
