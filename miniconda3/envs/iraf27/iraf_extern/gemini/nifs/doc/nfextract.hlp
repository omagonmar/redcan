NAME
nfextract -- Extract spectra
.ih
USAGE   
nfextract inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
List of input spectra.
.le
.ls outspectra = ""
List of output spectra.  There must be an equal number of input 
and output spectra. 
.le
.ls outprefix = "x"
Prefix  for  output spectra. Names of output files are the names
of the input images with a prefix attached.  \fIoutprefix\fR  is  used
if \fIoutspectra\fR="".
.le
.ls diameter = 0.5
Aperture diameter in arc second.
.le
.ls fl_inter = yes
Extract interactively?
.le
.ls xc = INDEF
X-position for an automatic spectrum extraction.
.le
.ls yc = INDEF
Y-position for an automatic spectrum extraction.
.le
.ls fl_zval = no
Set \fIfl_zval\fR to yes to use the \fIz1\fR and \fIz2\fR display range value.
.le
.ls z1 = 0.0, z2 = 10000.0
Minimum and maximum image intensity to be mapped to the minimum and maximum 
display levels.  These values apply when \fIfl_zval\fR is yes.
.le
.ls dispaxis = 1
Dispersion axis, if not defined in the header.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of logfile.  If empty, then the package logfile (nifs.logfile) is used.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Verbose output.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status.  Equal to 0 for proper completion, greater than 0 if an error 
occurred.
.le

.ce
Parameters from NSHEADERS
.sp
The following values are read from gnirs.nsheaders.
.ls key_dispaxis
Header keyword for the dispersion axis.
.le
.ls sci_ext
Name of science extension.
.le
.ls var_ext
Name of variance extension.
.le
.ls dq_ext
Name of data quality extension.
.le

DESCRIPTION 
NFEXTRACT extracts spectra from input images which are
processed through NSTRANSFORM.  Output is a 1-D spectra in
MEF format. Extracted spectra can be used as an input to
NFTELLURIC. Source extraction can be done in interactive &
non-interactive mode.
.sp
In the interactive extraction mode, an image will be
displayed on the already opened ximtool (or ds9), then a
user will be asked to mark the source on the ximtool screen
with any keystroke. Then, extracted source spectrum will be
displayed through SPLOT. Spectra extraction aperture
size can be changed via \fIaperture\fR and the default is
set to 0.5 arc second in diameter.
.sp
Spectrum extraction can be done in non-interactive mode also
which is useful in a script.  In this mode, a spectrum is
extracted from a user input position (xc,yc) with an
aperture size from \fIaperture\fR.  xc and yc are IFU pixel
positions (i.e., xc:1 through 29 and yc:1 through 69) which
can be measured from an image produced from NFIMAGE.
Note, however, that images create through NFIMAGE will have
different scale factors for x and y positions and this is to
account for the rectangular pixel of NIFS. To get (xc, yc)
from NFIMAGE (x,y), use relations:
.sp
.nf 
      xc = x / 5.0 
.fi
.nf 
      yc = y / 2.0 
.fi

EXAMPLES
1. Interactively extract a spectrum.
.sp
.nf
    cl> nfextract spectrum.fits fl_inter+
.fi
.sp
2. Run non-interactively on a set of spectra.
.sp
.nf
    cl> nfextract @filelist fl_inter- xc=15.0 yc=35.0 aperture=0.5
.fi
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The input spectra must be in multi-extension FITS format.
