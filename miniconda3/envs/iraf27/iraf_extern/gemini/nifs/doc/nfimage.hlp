NAME
nfimage -- Generate image of the IFU field from a dispersed NIFS frame
.ih
USAGE
nfimage image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image   
The integer number of the file to be reconstructed into an image.
.le
.ls prefix = "default"
The prefix of the file to be reconstructed into an image, for example,
N20060115S.
.le
.ls rootname = "adata$"
The directory where the raw NIFS images can be found.  The default here is set 
to be the main data directory at Gemini North.  This is because NFIMAGE is 
often used to collapse dispersed data into an image for acquisition purposes, 
defining the default directory to be the main data directory is done for 
convenience and speedier setups at the telescope.
.le
.ls sky = 0
The integer number of a sky frame to be subtracted from the main NIFS data 
frame.  NFIMAGE automatically requires that the sky file has the same prefix 
as the main NIFS frame to be reconstructed.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
Optional output name of the reconstructed IFU image. 
.le
.ls outprefix = "i"
The prefix set for output data from NFIMAGE.  If no output name is specified 
in \fIoutimages\fR, the reconstructed IFU image will be written to the working 
directory with this prefix prepended to the name of the input image.
.le
.ls mdf = "nifs$data/nifs-mdf.fits"
The definition file which describes the location and information for the NIFS 
IFU slits.
.le
.ls shiftx = 0.0
The shift value (in pixels) which describes the X-position of the lowermost 
full slice with respect to the slice center in the \fImdf\fR file.  0.0 should 
always be used for NIFS dispersed data.
.le
.ls shifty = 0.0
The shift value (in pixels) which describes the Y-position of the lowermost 
full slice with respect to the slice center in the \fImdf\fR file.  The 
\fIshifty\fR value is defined as the Y-position of the slice center in the 
\fImdf\fR file, subtracted from the Y-position of the bottom of the full slice 
in the image.   If \fIshifty\fR is the default value of 0.0 and NFIMAGE is run 
interactively, the user will be input into an IMEXAM session and will have to 
interactively determine the \fIshifty\fR value.  The value for \fIshifty\fR 
determined by running NFIMAGE interactively can be input into the task in 
order to bypass this IMEXAM session.
.le
.ls xpos = 0.0
The X-axis coordinate (in pixels) of the position in the reconstructed IFU 
field where the users want to offset their target to.  The default value of 
0.0 calculates an X-offset value which will center the target in the
X-dimension on the IFU field.  The \fIxpos\fR parameter is included for 
projects which wish to center a target at a location other than the field 
center (i.e., for occulting disk setups, for example.)
.le
.ls ypos = 0.0
The Y-axis coordinate (in pixels) of the position in the reconstructed IFU 
field where the users want to offset their target to.  The default value of 
0.0 calculates an Y-offset value which will center the target in the 
Y-dimension on the IFU field.  The \fIypos\fR parameter is included for 
projects which wish to center a target at a location other than the field 
center (i.e., for occulting disk setups, for example.)
.le
.ls yscale = 0.043
The spatial field scale (arcseconds) in the Y (spatial) direction of the raw 
IFU data.
.le
.ls dispaxis = 1
The value for the dispersion axis in the raw IFU data, 1 = X-axis dispersion.
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
Flag which permits the user to define if the \fIshifty\fR position is 
determined interactively in an IMEXAM session.
.le
.ls fl_display = yes
Flag giving the option to display each image in the user's image display tool. 
.le
.ls raw_frame = 1
Image display tool frame buffer to display the raw data into.
.le
.ls img_frame = 2
Image display tool frame buffer to display the reconstructed IFU image into.
.le
.ls fl_shift = yes
Flag giving the option to derive offsets from a position in the IFU image to 
either the center of the field (if \fIxpos\fR and \fIypos\fR are both 0.0) or 
to an X and Y position in the field defined by the user with the \fIxpos\fR 
and \fIypos\fR parameters.
.le
.ls fl_imexam = no
Run imexam on final image.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
The Name of the logfile.  The default value makes the task use the logfile name
defined by \fInifs.logfile\fR, or "nifs.log" if that is also not defined.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print verbose actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if NFIMAGE halted with an error.  This 
parameter is always set by the task and should not be modified by the user.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task takes a raw, spectrally dispersed NIFS frame, collapses it in the 
wavelength dimension, and pastes each of the 29 slices together to create an 
approximation of the 3" x 3" sky field that was observed.  This task has 
proved to be especially useful internally at Gemini through it's utility in 
speeding observation acquisitions on bright objects.  Hence, many of the 
default parameters (such as \fIprefix\fR and \fIrootname\fR) are set to be 
useful for the Gemini observers.  However, NFIMAGE is also very helpful for 
doing a quick, rough-and-dirty reconstruction of any sky field as derived from 
the input raw, dispersed NIFS frame.  When run interactively 
(\fIfl_inter\fR=yes) or for determining offset positions (\fIfl_shift\fR=yes), 
run the task and follow the instructions printed on the screen for the IMEXAM 
sessions.

EXAMPLES
1.  Reconstruct an image of the IFU field from a dispersed NIFS frame.  [Name
format: NYYYMMDDS0130.fits]
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfimage 130
.fi
.sp
2.  Run the routine non-interactively when the shift in Y is already known.
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfimage 130 shifty=-41.8 fl_inter-
.fi
.sp
3.  Run the routine with a different prefix:
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfimage 130 prefix=N20060118S
.fi
.sp
4.  Run the routine with a non-standard central offset position:
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfimage 130 xpos=64.5 ypos=83.0
.fi
.sp
5.  Run the routine with sky subtraction:
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfimage 130 sky=131
.fi
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
Currently, a main limitation with NFIMAGE is that the routine does not handle 
input files that do not have a standard Gemini naming convention with a 
prefix + an integer file number.
