NAME
nfacquire -- Generate image of the NIFS IFU field for acquisition
.ih
USAGE
nfacquire image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image   
The integer number of the file to be reconstructed into an image.
.le
.ls rootname = "default"
The rootname of the file to be reconstructed into an image, for example,
N20060115S.
.le
.ls datadir = "adata$"
The directory where the raw NIFS images can be found.  The default here is set 
to be the main data directory at Gemini North.  This is because NFACQUIRE is 
often used to reconstruct flip-mirror data into an image for acquisition 
purposes, defining the default directory to be the main data directory is done 
for convenience and speedier setups at the telescope.
.le
.ls sky = 0
The integer number of a sky frame to be subtracted from the main NIFS data 
frame.  NFACQUIRE automatically requires that the sky file has the same 
rootname as the main NIFS frame to be reconstructed.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
Optional output name of the reconstructed IFU image. 
.le
.ls outprefix = "a"
The prefix set for output data from NFACQUIRE.  If no output name is specified 
in \fIoutimages\fR, the reconstructed IFU image will be written to the working 
directory with this prefix prepended to the name of the input image.
.le
.ls mdf = "nifs$data/nifs-mdf.fits"
The definition file which describes the location and information for the NIFS 
IFU slits.
.le
.ls shiftx = 0.0
The shift value (in pixels) which describes the X-position of the lowermost 
full slice with respect to the slice center in the \fImdf\fR file.  The 
\fIshiftx\fR value is defined as the X-position of the slice center in the 
\fImdf\fR file, subtracted from either the central X-position of the bottom of 
the full slice in the flip mirror image or the X-position of the center of an 
emission line.   If \fIshiftx\fR is the default value of 0.0 and NFACQUIRE is 
run interactively, the user will be input into an IMEXAM session and will have 
to determine interactively the \fIshiftx\fR value.  The value for \fIshiftx\fR 
determined by running NFACQUIRE interactively can be input into the task in 
order to bypass this IMEXAM session.
.le
.ls shifty = 0.0
The shift value (in pixels) which describes the Y-position of the lowermost 
full slice with respect to the slice center in the \fImdf\fR file.  The 
\fIshifty\fR value is defined as the Y-position of the slice center in the 
\fImdf\fR file, subtracted from the Y-position of the bottom of the full slice 
in the image.   If \fIshifty\fR is the default value of 0.0 and NFACQUIRE is 
run interactively, the user will be input into an IMEXAM session and will have 
to interactively determine the \fIshifty\fR value.  The value for \fIshifty\fR 
determined by running NFACQUIRE interactively can be input into the task in 
order to bypass this IMEXAM session.
.le
.ls xpos = 0.0
The X-axis coordinate (in pixels) of the position in the reconstructed IFU 
field where the user wants to offset their target to.  The default value of 
0.0 calculates an X offset value which will center the target in the 
X-dimension on the IFU field.  The \fIxpos\fR parameter is included for 
projects which wish to center a target at a location other than the field 
center (i.e., for occulting disk setups, for example.)
.le
.ls ypos = 0.0
The Y-axis coordinate (in pixels) of the position in the reconstructed IFU 
field where the user wants to offset their target to.  The default value of 
0.0 calculates an Y offset value which will center the target in the 
Y-dimension on the IFU field.  The \fIypos\fR parameter is included for 
projects which wish to center a target at a location other than the field 
center (i.e., for occulting disk setups, for example.)
.le
.ls yscale = 0.043
The spatial field scale (arcseconds) in the Y (spatial) direction of the raw 
IFU data.
.le
.ls dispaxis = 1
The value for the dispersion axis in the raw IFU data, 1 = X-axis dispersion.
.le
.ls fl_inter = yes
Flag which permits the user to define if the \fIshiftx\fR and \fIshifty\fR 
positions are determined interactively in an IMEXAM session.
.le
.ls fl_display = yes
Flag giving the option to display each image in the user's image display tool. 
.le
.ls raw_frame = 1
Image display tool frame buffer to display the raw data into.
.le
.ls img_frame = 2
Image display tool frame buffer to display the reconstructed IFU image into.
.le
.ls fl_shift = yes
Flag giving the option to derive offsets from a position in the IFU image to 
either the center of the field (if \fIxpos\fR and \fIypos\fR are both 0.0) or 
to an X and Y position in the field defined by the user with the \fIxpos\fR and
\fIypos\fR parameters.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
The name of the logfile.  The default value makes the task use the \fIlogfile\fR
defined by \fInifs.logfile\fR, or "nifs.log" if the latter is also undefined.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print verbose actions to the screen.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if NFACQUIRE halted with an error.  This 
parameter is always set by the task and should not be modified by the user.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task takes a raw, NIFS flip mirror frames and pastes each of the 29 slices 
together to create an approximation of the 3" x 3" sky field that was observed. 
This task also works with spectrally dispersed data, and can be used to 
reconstruct an image over a strong emission feature. This task is used 
internally at Gemini to speed observation acquisitions.  Hence, many of the 
default parameters (such as \fIrootname\fR and \fIdatadir\fR) are set to be 
useful for the Gemini observers.  However, NFACQUIRE is also very helpful for 
doing a quick, rough-and-dirty reconstruction of any sky field as derived from 
the input raw NIFS frame.  When run interactively (\fIfl_inter\fR=yes) or for 
determining offset positions (\fIfl_shift\fR=yes), run the task and follow the 
instructions printed on the screen for the IMEXAM sessions.

EXAMPLES
1. Reconstruct an image of the IFU field from acquisition image NYYYYMMDDS0130.
(Basic usage.)
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfacquire 130
.fi
.sp
2. Run the routine non-interactively when the X and Y shifts are already known.
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfacquire 130 shiftx=0.0 shifty=-41.8 fl_inter-
.fi
.sp
3. Run the routine with a local file and different rootname.
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfacquire 130 rootname=N20060118S datadir="."
.fi
.sp
4. Run the routine with a non-standard central offset position.
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfacquire 130 xpos=64.5 ypos=83.0
.fi
.sp
5. To run the routine with sky subtraction.
.sp
.nf
    ni> nfacquire 130 sky=131
.fi
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
Currently, a main limitation with NFACQUIRE is that the routine does not 
handle input files that do not have a standard Gemini naming convention with a 
rootname + an integer file number.
