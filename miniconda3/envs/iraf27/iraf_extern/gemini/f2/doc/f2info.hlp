NAME
f2info -- Generic information on FLAMINGOS-2 data and reduction

USAGE

DESCRIPTION

The F2 package contains tasks for processing FLAMINGOS-2 imaging, longslit 
and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) data. Many routines for the proper 
reduction of infrared imaging and spectroscopic data already exist within the 
Gemini IRAF package. Therefore, imaging, longslit and MOS reduction will also
make use of the tasks in the NIRI and GNIRS packages, respectively. The
specifics of the individual tasks can be found in their help files.

This document describes the general use tasks specific to the F2 package and
gives a description of the FLAMINGOS-2 data format. For information on the NIRI
and GNIRS packages, see \fIniriinfo\fR and \fIgnirsinfo\fR, respectively. More
details on data processing for each configuration are available in
\fIf2infoimaging\fR (imaging), \fIf2infols\fR (longslit) and \fIf2infomos\fR
(MOS). In addition, the \fIf2examples\fR task provides sample processing
scripts for all configurations.

The F2PREPARE task is used to prepare the FLAMINGOS-2 raw data from Gemini 
South. The output imaging, longslit and MOS data from F2PREPARE are similar to
the native format for NIRI imaging, GNIRS longslit and GNIRS cross-dispersed
data, respectively. This allows for subsequent processing with the NIRI and
GNIRS packages. 

The tasks are designed to provide a fairly complete and flexible reduction for 
the purpose of assessing data quality at the time of observation. Real-time 
reductions may not be optimal for a particular science application. The F2, 
NIRI and GNIRS package scripts can be optimised for a particular application
using the hidden parameters to achieve the best possible results.

The tasks produce logfiles for the performed processing steps. The name of the 
logfile may be set in each individual task or at the package level by setting 
\fIf2.logfile\fR.

The tasks add header keywords to the output images. These header keywords 
contain information about the performed processing steps and the values of the 
critical parameters that were used.

All FLAMINGOS-2 images are written as multi-extension FITS (MEF) files. Raw 
data have two unnamed extensions. Most of the header information is written to 
the primary header unit (PHU), which is extension [0]. The data read from the 
array is in the pixel data extension, which is extension [1].

It is recommended to use \fIimtype\fR="fits". This is set automatically when 
loading the GEMINI package.

HEADER PARAMETERS

The task NSHEADERS sets the header parameters used by the various tasks in 
the F2, NIRI and GNIRS packages (some header values that have values fixed by
IRAF or FITS conventions are not included, since they cannot be changed). After
being processed with F2PREPARE, FLAMINGOS-2 data extensions will be named as
defined by NSHEADERS. 

Before beginning to reduce FLAMINGOS-2 data, NSHEADERS should always be run:
   
    ecl> nsheaders f2

Note that not all header parameters named in NSHEADERS need appear in the raw 
data. Some are used internally by the F2, NIRI and GNIRS packages. Others are
used by F2PREPARE alone.

SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GENERAL USE TASKS IN THE F2 PACKAGE

.ls F2PREPARE - Prepare raw FLAMINGOS-2 data for reduction

All raw FLAMINGOS-2 data must be processed with F2PREPARE before further 
processing. F2PREPARE adds certain essential header keywords to the PHU. By 
default (see NSHEADERS), the extension names are SCI for science data, VAR for 
variance and DQ for data quality (0 = good). The variance and data quality 
extensions can be computed by setting the \fIfl_vardq\fR parameter to yes.
F2PREPARE can also apply a linearity correction by setting the \fIfl_correct\fR
parameter to yes (not yet implemented). Saturated and/or non-linear pixels can
be flagged by setting the \fIfl_saturated\fR and/or \fIfl_nonlinear\fR
parameters to yes. In addition, bad pixels will be flagged if an input bad
pixel mask (BPM) is given for the value of the \fIbpm\fR parameter. Information
about the array characteristics are contained in a FITS look-up table called
f2array.fits. Finally, F2PREPARE will add an MDF file, describing which areas
of the image contain useful information, to MOS data.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The tasks in the F2, NIRI and GNIRS packages are designed to operate on MEF
images that have been processed using F2PREPARE. The task F2PREPARE will not
run on data from instruments other than FLAMINGOS-2 and will not run on simple
FITS files.
