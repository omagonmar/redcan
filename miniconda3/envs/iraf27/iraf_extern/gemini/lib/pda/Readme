Starlink PDA subroutines
------------------------

The subroutines in this directory were provided by the UK Starlink
project, as part of their Public Domain Algorithms library - a
distribution of numerical algorithms from several sources. A complete
set of the source code and documentation can be downloaded from
http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk.

A few minor changes have been made to the code included here,
originally for use in the imspec IRAF package ("Astronomy with
Integral Field Spectroscopy...", James Turner, Ph.D., 2001). The
routines JDBVIP/JDPTIP were modified further in April 2009 to return
a second array of "data quality" information, flagging data outside
the interpolation bounds in the main output array.

The IDBVIP interpolation code and associated subroutines were
originally published by H. Akima in ACM Transactions on Mathematical
Software (vol4. no.2, June 1978). The copyright belongs to the
Association for Computing Machinery, which gives permission for
non-commercial distribution (see TOMS vol. 12, no. 2, June 1986).
