NAME
nscombine -- Shift and combine images.
.ih
USAGE
nscombine inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
Input images to shift and combine. 
The input frames can be entered as a comma separated
list or from a file using the @ character.
.le
.ls tolerance = 0.5
Frames separated by a distance smaller than \fItolerance\fR are 
combined without
shifting. The separations are calculated from the world-coordinates
system information in the headers. The tolerance is in units of arcseconds.
.le
.ls output = ""
File name for output shifted and combined spectra. The default value 
will take the first frame in the input \fIframes\fR and add the 
suffix \fIoutput_suffix\fR to it. 
.le
.ls output_suffix = "_comb"
Suffix for the output shifted and combined image.
.le
.ls bpm = ""
Name of bad pixel mask file. Used with GEMCOMBINE. 
.le
.ls dispaxis = 1
The dispersion axis, if not present in the image headers (see 
\fIkey_dispaxis\fR below).
.le
.ls pixscale = 1.
The pixel scale is taken from the header of the images. If it is not in the
header under the name \fIkey_pixscale\fR (see below), its value is taken from
\fIpixscale\fR. The units are arcsec/pixel.
.le
.ls fl_cross = no
Use the task NSOFFSET to measure the offset via cross-correlation?
.sp
NOTE - this will not work on all IRAF versions.  See "Known Problem
With fl_apply" in help for NSOFFSET.  In such cases the task will
continue as if \fIfl_cross-\fR.
.le
.ls fl_keepshift = no
The shifted frames are not deleted on completion when this flag is yes.
Shifted files have the suffix "_shift". 
.le
.ls fl_shiftint = yes
Integer shifts are done when this flag is yes. For subpixel shifts, set this
flag to no.
.le
.ls interptype = "linear" (nearest|linear|poly3|poly5|spline3|sinc|drizzle)
Interpolation type for shifting. See IMSHIFT.
.le
.ls boundary = "nearest" (constant|nearest|reflect|wrap)
Boundary type for shifting. See IMSHIFT.
.le
.ls constant = 0.
Constant value for boundary extension when shifting. See IMSHIFT
.le
.ls combtype = "average" (average|median)
Combination operation used with GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls rejtype = "sigclip" (none|minmax|ccdclip|crreject|sigclip|avsigclip|pclip)
Rejection algorithm used when combining the frames. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls masktype = "goodvalue"  (none|goodvalue)
Type of pixel masking to use.  See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls maskvalue = 0.
Mask value used with the \fImasktype\fR parameter. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls statsec = "[*,*]"
Section in frames from where the statistics for scaling, weighting, and
normalizing are computed. If no section is given, the statistics in the entire 
image are computed. 
.le
.ls scale = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|exposure|!<keyword>)
Input frames can be scaled before combining. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls zero = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|!<keyword>)
Input frames can be shifted in intensity before combining. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls weight = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|exposure|!<keyword>)
Weights to be applied during the final combination. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls lthreshold = INDEF, hthreshold = INDEF
Low  and  high  thresholds  to  be  applied to the input pixels.
This is done before scaling, rejecting, and  combining.   If
INDEF the thresholds are not used. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls nlow = 1,  nhigh = 1 (minmax)
The  number  of  low  and  high  pixels  to  be  rejected by the
"minmax" algorithm. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls nkeep = 0
The minimum number of pixels to retain or the maximum number  to
reject  when  using  the clipping algorithms (ccdclip, crreject,
sigclip, avsigclip, or pclip). See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls mclip = yes (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip)
Use the median as the estimate for  the  true  intensity  rather
than  the  average  with  high  and  low  values excluded in the
"ccdclip", "crreject", "sigclip", and "avsigclip" algorithms? See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls lsigma = 5., hsigma = 5. (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip, pclip)
Low  and  high  sigma  clipping  factors  for   the   "ccdclip", 
"crreject", "sigclip", "avsigclip", and "pclip" algorithms. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls ron = 0.0, gain = 1.0 
CCD  readout noise in electrons and gain in electrons/DN.  These
parameters  are  used  with   the   "ccdclip"   and   "crreject" 
algorithms.   They are used only if values do not appear in the
data headers.
.le
.ls snoise = "0.0" (ccdclip, crreject)
Sensitivity noise as a fraction. See GEMCOMBINE
.le
.ls sigscale = 0.1 (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip)
This parameter determines when poisson corrections are  made  to
the  computation  of  a  sigma  for  images with different scale
factors. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls pclip = -0.5 (pclip)
Percentile clipping algorithm parameter. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls grow = 0.0
Radius in pixels for additional pixels to be rejected in an
image with a rejected pixel selected by one of the rejection 
algorithms. See GEMCOMBINE.
.le
.ls nrejfile = ""
Base name of output file with number of rejected pixels for each science 
extension within a group.  
This is intended for debugging/investigating the rejection behaviour.
The extension indices within the file are sequentially numbered from 
zero and correspond to the output science frames.  
There are no extension names or versions and the file does not 
contain a PHU.
See \fIimcombine.nrejmasks\fR.
.le
.ls fl_vardq = yes
Make variance and data quality planes?
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
Find cross-correlation peak interactively (if \fIfl_cross+\fR)?  See 
the NSOFFSET help for a discussion of when this may be necessary.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of logfile.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print actions to the screen.
.le
.ls debug = no
Print detailed actions to the screen.
.le
.ls force = no
The GEMOFFSETLIST task may not work on versions of IRAF before 2.12.2a.
Setting this flag ignores a test for those versions when that task is
called.
.le
.ls status = 0
Exit status will be non-zero if the procedure halted with an
error. This parameter is always set by the task, and should
not be modified by the user.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task shifts and combines the input frames \fIinimages\fR taken at
different positions. The relative positions are calculated from the
WCS information in the image PHUs.  These are calculated with the task
GEMOFFSETLIST which also writes them to the header. NSCOMBINE takes
the offsets from the header and the pixel scale as defined by the
parameters \fIkey_pixscale\fR or \fIpixscale\fR.
.sp
If \fIfl_cross+\fR then, after grouping the images with GEMOFFSETLIST,
an observation from each group is cross-correlated with the first
image listed (taken as the reference position) to provide a more
accurate (hopefully) offset.  See the help for NSOFFSET for more
details, including current limitations with IRAF and when to use the
\fIfl_inter\fR parameter.
.sp
With the offsets in detector units, the images are shifted with the
task IMSHIFT. The task IMSHIFT requires the parameters
\fIinterp_type\fR, \fIboundary\fR, and \fRconstant\fR. Once all images
are shifted, they are combined with GEMCOMBINE.
.sp
Frames can be shifted by subpixels if the parameter \fIfl_shiftint\fR
is set to "no". The default is to shift the images by integer
pixels.
.sp
The shifted frames are saved if \fIfl_keepshift\fR is yes and the name
of the shifted frames is the name of the input frame with the suffix
"_shift" added. 
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Shift and combine frames in input.lst. Frames closer than 1 arcsec are 
not shifted.
