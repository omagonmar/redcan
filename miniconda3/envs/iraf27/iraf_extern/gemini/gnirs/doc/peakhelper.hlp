peakhelper -- Provide the basic transform necessary for NFFLT2PIN

USAGE
peakhelper inimage outimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimage = ""
The input data, typically a flat, used to generate the "pinhole".
This should identify a frame directly (no expansion is done to find
science extensions etc).
.le
.ls outimage = ""
The name of the image to generate, using the algorithm described below.
.le
.ls threshold = 100
The threshold used to discriminate between emission and dark regions
in \fIinimage\fR.

DESCRIPTION

This task does the basic processing for NFFLT2PIN.  That task should
be called by users, as it provides a more flexible interface and
works with data in the format expected for Gemini data.

A synthetic pinhole is generated by replacing the emission in the
input observations with "peaks".  Regions of emission are identified
by comparing the level with \fIthreshold\fR.

Each row in the input data is scanned in turn, and areas of emission
identified.  The output image is zero outside the emission.  Inside
the emission, the output is the distance to the edge of the emission
region, squared.

Note that this task does not respect DISPAXIS.  That is handled by
NFFLT2PIN.

For more information, see the NFFLT2PIN documentation.
