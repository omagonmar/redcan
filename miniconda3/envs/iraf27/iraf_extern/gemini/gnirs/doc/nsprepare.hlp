USAGE
nsprepare inimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inimages
Filenames for unprocessed data in the fits format, as generated by the
instrument.  \fIinimages\fR may be given as a comma separated list, a
@filelist, or using wildcards.
.le
.ls rawpath = ""
A path to a directory where the \fIinimages\fR are found.  This
parameter allows \fInsprepare\fR to be run in a new, empty directory,
copying the data required from an archive directory.
.le
.ls outimages = ""
A list of output image names.  The list must contain as many names as
appear in \fIinimages\fR.  If this parameter is empty then
\fIoutprefix\fR is used instead.
.le
.ls outprefix = "n"
Prefix for output images.  If \fIoutimages\fR is not given, then this
parameter is used to construct the names of the output images from the
names of the input images.
.le
.ls bpm = "gnirs$data/gnirsn_2012dec05_bpm.fits"
A mask file to flag known bad pixels in the detector.  A suitable file
is generated by NSFLAT.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Name of logfile.  The GNIRS package logfile "gnirs.log" is used by default.
.le
.ls fl_vardq = yes
Should variance and data quality extensions be generated?  Other tasks
in the gemini packages attempt to maintain these values.  They appear
as fits extensions with names VAR and DQ.
.le
.ls fl_cravg = no
Attempt to flag cosmic ray and radiation events using the
noao.imred.crutil task?  The parameters are tuned to detect the
radiation events generated by the short camera lens coating, but
results are only partially successful because these events persist
over time, decaying slowly, and so become too small to be reliably
detected, even though they may still affect data.
.le
.ls crradius = 0
Growth radius for bad pixels.  This allows pixels neighbouring those
classified as cosmic rays or radiation events to be excluded from
analysis.  Used only if \fIfl_cravg\fR is selected.
.le
.ls fl_dark_mdf = no
Force the attachment of an MDF to dark frames?  The MDF describes how
to cut the data (eg to discard data outside the slit, or isolate a
particular cross-dispersed order) and the selection of an MDF is based
on various header parameters (see \fIconfigtable\fR).
.sp
Since the same dark frames may be used for a variety of different
configurations they typically do not have an instrument configuration
that will determine the "correct" MDF.  So it is normally not useful
to associate an MDF with a dark frame in NSPREPARE.
.sp
Dark frames without MDF data will be handled correctly by NSREDUCE and
NSFLAT - the MDF from the data being reduced will be used if required.
.le
.ls fl_correct = yes
Correct for data non-linearity?  This uses the task irred.irlincor and
the coefficients defined in \fIarraytable\fR.
.le
.ls fl_saturated = yes, fl_nonlinear = yes
Flag saturated and non-linear pixels in the DQ array 
(if \fIfl_vardq\fR=yes)?
.le
.ls fl_checkwcs = yes
This checks the CRVAL and CD values in the PHU against what would be
expected given the RA, DEC, PA and PIXSCALE.  The WCS matrix (CDij) is
expected to differ by no more than 5% of the pixel scale from that
predicted, the observation RA and DEC must lie within, approximately,
the observation, and the position of the "pointing position" (where the 
telescope is pointing for that observation) in sequential observations
must not shift by more than two pixels.  These seem to be sufficient to 
detect most errors without giving false alarms.
.sp
This task can be re-run on data already prepared.  In such cases, the data
are not changed, but the WCS is still checked.
.le
.ls fl_forcewcs = yes
This forces the data to use a WCS calculated by the nsprepare code from
the RA, DEC, PA and pixel scale.  This is necessary for most GNIRS data as 
the WCS in the raw data are not correct (check output of fl_checkwcs to see).  
Use with care, it may not always be correct.
.le
.ls arraytable = "gnirs$data/array.fits"
The table that defines, for any particular bias level (column bias
(V)), the following array related parameters: readnoise and gain
(columns readnoise (electrons) and gain (electrons/ADU)); well depth
(column well (adu)), linearlimit and nonlinearlimit (columns
linearlimit and nonlinearlimit (fraction of well)); coefficients for
non-linear correct (columns coeff1, coeff2 and coeff3).
.sp
Bias is determined using \fInsheaders.key_bias\fR header value.
.le
.ls configtable = "gnirs$data/config.fits"
The table that defines which MDF (column mdf) to use for any
particular combination of prism and decker values (columns prism and
decker).  It also defines pixel scale and the section to use for
calculating the offset (columns pixscale and offsetsection).
.sp
Prism and decker are determined using the \fInsheaders.key_prism\fR and
\fInsheaders.key_decker\fR header values.
.sp
The MDF format is defined at
.sp
http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gmos/gmosMOSobserver.html
.sp
An additional field - specorder - is used by the gnirs package to
associate a particular row of the table with a cross-dispersed order.
.le
.ls specsec = "[*,*]"
If no MDF file is found via \fIconfigtable\fR then this parameter is
used to define either a section directly (if the first character is
"["), or name an appropriate MDF file.
.le
.ls offsetsec = "none" (none|config|section|value)
This defines how the offset value should be calculated.  The offset is
a bias level in the output from the detector which can be measured and
subtracted in this task.  See below for a more detailed discussion.
.sp
Acceptable values for this parameter are "none", in which case no
correction is made; "config" to use the section defined in the appropriate
row of \fIconfigtable\fR (in the case of dark frames [*,*] will be used
instead); an image section (eg [1:10,*]) from which the value will be
measured; or a direct value (eg 12.34).  When the value is measured from
a section (either specified directly, or from \fIconfigtable\fR) the
median value of points within three sigma of the median is used (i.e.,
initial median and sigma values are used to exclude outliers before
re-measuring the median).
.le
.ls pixscale = 0.15
If no MDF file is found via \fIconfigtable\fR then this parameter is
used to define the pixel scale (arcsec).
.le
.ls shiftimage = ""
An earlier image from which MDF shifts should be copied.  The \fIshiftx\fR
and \fIshifty\fR values are read from the MDF_SHFX and MDF_SHFY header
entries in the PHU.
.le
.ls shiftx = 0., shifty = 0.
Pixel shifts for the MDF (used if \fIshiftimage\fR="").  
These values are subtracted from x_ccd and 
y_ccd in the MDF file associated with the data.
.sp
If both values are set to INDEF the shift will be estimated by
cross-correlating the MDF with the first file using the task NSOFFSET.
In this case, all files must use the same MDF.
.le
.ls obstype = "FLAT"
If cross-correlation is used to position the MDF, the list of input files 
will be searched to
find an entry for which the header entry identified by 
\fInsheaders.key_obstype\fR has the value \fIobstype\fR.  This frame will
be used (prepared first) to measure the cross-correlation.
.sp
Science data frames should be avoided if they have bright emission that
is not centred in the slit.
.sp
If no value is given, the first frame will be used.
.le
.ls fl_inter = no
Fit the offset (i.e., run nsoffset) interactively?
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Generate additional output in the log?
.le
.ls status = 0
This flag is non-zero after execution of NSPREPARE if a fatal error
was encountered.
.le

DESCRIPTION
NSPREPARE prepares GNIRS data for further processing within the
GEMINI.GNIRS package.  Preparation includes the following steps:
.ls Validating data
The input data are checked (eg they must exist, be MEF format files;
the bpm, if given, must match the data size, etc.)
.le
.ls Dark detection
The PHU is checked to see whether the value of the
\fInsheaders.key_dark\fR matches \fInsheaders.val_dark\fR.  If so,
then no MDF will be attached to the data unless \fIfl_dark_mdf\fR is
set.
.le
.ls Reading array data
Header values and \fIarraytable\fR are used to define the detector
characteristics (see table description under parameter \fIarraytable\fR).  
The absolute value of the bias must be within 0.1V
of a bias level in the table.
.le
.ls Saturation and linear limit levels
The saturation level is calculated by scaling the well depth from the
array data by the number of coadds used to generate the data.  The
linear limits is then some fixed fraction of this: if the data are to
be corrected for non-linearity (\fIfl_correct\fR) then linearlimit is
used, otherwise nonlinearlimit is used (see \fIarraytable\fR).
.le
.ls Correction for non-destructive reads
GNIRS data taken before 17 March 2004 are divided by the number of 
non-destructive reads (not done in the raw data). Data after those 
dates already have this correction in the raw frames.
.le
.ls Correction for offset
The offset is a constant bias level within each observation that does
not contribute to the noise in the data.  It is a detector artifact and,
unfortunately, not easily separated from dark current (which does
contribute to noise in the data) - any correction for offset is also
likely to remove the dark current.  For most data the best compromise
is probably to measure and remove the offset from a dark area of the
data within nsprepare, before calculating the variance.
.sp
The location of a suitable, unexposed region on the detector which can 
be used to measure offset depends on the instrument configuration in
the same way as the MDF.  It is convenient, therefore, to use sections
defined in \fIconfigtable\fR (by setting \fIoffsetsec\fR=config).  However,
the configuration table is not normally used for dark frames (see 
discussion for \fIfl_dark_mdf\fR) and so the whole image (section [*,*])
is used if \fIfl_dark_mdf\fR=no and \fIoffsetsec\fR=config, since by 
definition a dark frame is not exposed.
If a different behaviour is required, process dark frames with NSPREPARE
separately and set \fIoffsetsec\fR appropriately (see parameter description).
.le
.ls Correction for non-linearity
The science data are corrected for non-linearity using the task irlincor
and the coefficients from \fIarraytable\fR, if \fIfl_correct\fR is set.
This correction is made after correcting for offset and adjusted for
the number of coadds.
.le
.ls Calculating variance
If \fIfl_var_dq\fR is set then the variance array is calculated as 
.nf
  (read noise/gain)^2 + max(data,0.0)/gain
.fi
This calculation is made after correcting for offset and non-linearity.
.le
.ls Calculating data quality
If \fIfl_var_dq\fR is set then the data quality values are as follows:
.nf
  0 good data
  2 data exceed linear limit
  4 data saturated
.fi
In addition, values from \fIbpm\fR are included if that parameter is
specified.  Corrected data are used (non-linearity levels from 
\fIarraytable\fR are different with and without linearity correction).
.le
.ls Detect cosmic rays and radiation events
If \fIfl_cravg\fR is set then the data quality array is modified to
reflect the presence of cosmic rays and radiation event in the data.
.le
.ls Calculate correct WCS
Early GNIRS data had missing or incorrect WCS information. Moreover, 
later GNIRS WCS information was incorrect depending on the camera and 
configuration. Often the pointing information was inconsistent.  Sometimes
the WCS CD matrix was missing.
.sp
Depending on the date of the data, the task will correct the pointing
and calculate an estimate of the WCS CD matrix.  Note that these 
corrections are only approximate.  Corrected data should not be used for
astrometry, for example, and all assumptions about spatial orientation
should be carefully checked.
.le

.ce
Using NSOFFSET to align the MDF
.sp
If \fIshiftx\fR and \fIshifty\fR are both INDEF, then the task NSOFFSET
will be used to align the MDF with the first data frame that is not a 
dark (assuming \fIfl_dark_mdf-\fR).  The offset (and direction) will be
written to the log and recorded in the PHU of each processed file.
.sp
Since there is no guarantee that NSOFFSET will measure exactly the
same shift for different data, it is important to make sure that all
data are processed consistently.  The simplest way is to run NSPREPARE
on all observations in a single pass.  Alternatively, use the
automatic shift for the first set of data and then provide an image
via the \fIshiftimage\fR parameter to copy that shift on subsequent
sets (or specify the same shift by hand using \fIshiftx\fR and 
\fIshifty\fR).
.ih

.fi
2. Prepare the data in \fIfiles.lis\fR, correct the WCS (recommended for
all GNIRS data), and let nsprepare calculate the MDF shift in the x 
direction (first image in list should be a flat).
