<P>
The design of the HSTIO interface is based on two principles: adequate
modeling and encapsulation.  The high-level data structures form a
complete representation of basic instrument data and all associated
keywords, as well as meaningful groups of these data and keywords, thus
forming an adequate model of data from the instruments.  The I/O
functions include all functions needed to support these high-level data
structures, including translating between the external disk
representation and the internal data structures.  Implementation details
are carefully concealed within these I/O functions, thus employing the
principle of encapsulation.
<P>
There are two important consequences of this design: flexibility in
usage and flexibility in implementation.  First, by encapsulating all
I/O operations within the HSTIO interface, the pipeline calibrations can
be written in the form of pure algorithms, with no operating system
dependencies.  Furthermore, since these algorithms are being implemented
in a widely available standard language (ANSI C), they are easily used
in other environments or even translated into other languages. 
Second, encapsulation also allows alternative implementations of the I/O
functions without impacting the calibration algorithms.  The low-level
I/O functions are currently implemented using IRAF, but they do not have
to be.  A preliminary version already exists implementing the low-level
functions using FITS C++ classes with no use of IRAF whatever.  This is
completely transparent to the calibration algorithms using these
functions and data structures.
