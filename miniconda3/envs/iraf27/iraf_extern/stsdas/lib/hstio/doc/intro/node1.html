STIS and NICMOS (New, 1995), instruments to be installed aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope during the 1997 servicing mission, are extremely
flexible and can be used in many different modes.  Consequently, the
data produced by these instruments contains complex internal
relationships as well as external associations with other data groups. 
This paper will discuss the basic structure of the data from STIS and
NICMOS and the structure of the software that provides access to the data.
This software is being used in the STScI calibration pipelines for these
instruments.
<P>
The calibration software is being written in strict conformity to ANSI C, 
(which includes the standard ANSI C library), with no special vendor 
extensions allowed.  The pipeline software is modular in design with 
minimal and managed dependencies on the operating system in which the 
software executes.  The pipeline utilizes the IRAF software environment 
(Tody, 1986).  However, any IRAF routines employed use the OpenIRAF 
software environment, which allows IRAF library routines to be called 
from an ANSI C program.  The design perspective toward IRAF is the same 
as that toward an operating system, viz., managed and minimal 
dependencies.  The use of IRAF routines is confined primarily to basic I/O 
routines or special STSDAS (Hanisch, 1989) packages, such as synphot.
<P>
ANSI C data structures represent both uncalibrated and calibrated data
from each instrument, forming a data model of each instrument.  The
pipeline software consists of calibration steps that operate on these
data structures.  A major goal is to make the calibration algorithms
themselves only dependent on these data structures.  All I/O is
encapsulated in basic routines that form a mapping between these
data structures and external storage media.
<P>
Exceptions to this goal are calibration steps for which I/O becomes a
significant part of the algorithm itself, e. g. when there is
insufficient memory to contain all the needed data.  In this case, I/O
needs will be satisfied by calls to the interface module, leaving the
algorithms themselves free of any direct, low-level I/O.  This issue
will likely be significant to STIS.
