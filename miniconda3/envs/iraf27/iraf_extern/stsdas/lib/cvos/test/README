 This directory contains the following source files which correspond to
 examples in the CVOS User's Guide.  The names of the source files have
 been modified slightly from the examples presented in the CVOS User's 
 Guide in order to be unique and to generate uniquely named executables.  
 In order to compile the source code, one must either rename the uniquely
 named mkpkg file to "mkpkg" (e.g., rename h_mkpkg to mkpkg), or one must
 explicitly name on the command line the mkpkg file to be interpreted 
 (e.g., mkpkg -f h_mkpkg).

 Please note that due to potential conflicts in file name length, a new macro 
 (IRAF_SZ_FNAME) will be defined in the c_iraf.h file in the next version of
 the CVOS.  At this time, the source files here define and use the local
 SZ_FNAME macro.
