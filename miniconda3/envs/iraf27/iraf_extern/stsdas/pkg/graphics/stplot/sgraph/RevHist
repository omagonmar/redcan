22 April 1997 - WJH
	The code in 'ggrdcurve.x' was modified to handle tables with
	arrays as an element (ie, 3-D tables).  This code will process
	row selectors appended to the filename.  The basic code was
	originally developed by B. Simon, adapted by I. Busko, and fit
	in place here. The cases dealing with the number of words have
	been modified to include branching to handle (in one case)
	normal SDAS/text tables and (in the other case) 3-D tables.  
	Summary: Files updated were---
		ggrdcurve.x
		getimtitle.x

Created the sgraph subdirectory of the stplot package.  Separated the
former t_sgraph.x into multiple files, mostly by individual
procedures.  The file names largely reflect the procedure names, with
no "_".  Created a new mkpkg that still checks the objects into the
stplot library.

Created the include file sgraph.h to contain defines local to sgraph.
