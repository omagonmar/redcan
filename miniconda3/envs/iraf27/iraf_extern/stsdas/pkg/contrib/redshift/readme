REDSHIFT -- Package to obtain redshifts and velocity dispersions

The local package REDSHIFT defined in this directory was developed by
Gerard Kriss at Johns Hopkins University to obtain redshifts and
velocity dispersions using either the Fourier quotient technique or
cross correlation methods.  It consists of two tasks: "fquot" and "xcor".

To install this package in your local IRAF system, take the following steps:

1)	Create a directory "redshift" in your local$tasks directory
	and load this software into it.

2)	Add to local$tasks/local.cl the package definition:

	task	$redshift	=	local$tasks/redshift/redshift.cl

3)	Place fquot.hlp and xcor.hlp in local$tasks/doc

4)	Add to local$tasks/local.hd :

	fquot	hlp=doc$fquot.hlp,	src=fquot.x
	xcor	hlp=doc$xcor.hlp,	src=xcor.x

5)	Add to local$tasks/local.men:

	redshift - Package for determining redshifts and dispersions

6)	Execute softools.mkhelpdb to recompile the help database

7)	Add @redshift to the update section of local$tasks/mkpkg

8)	Do a mkpkg update in local$tasks to compile and link the new package.

*****************************************************************************

Alternatively, an individual user may partially support the redshift package
in his/her own file space.

1)	Create a "redshift" directory in your own file space.

2)	Do a "mkpkg personal" in that directory to compile and link the package.

3)	Add the following lines to your login.cl file in the default USER
	package section:

		task	xcor = "<redshift directory pathname>/x_xcor.e"
		task	fquot = "<redshift directory pathname>/x_fquot.e"

	These tasks will now be part of your default user package whenever you
	start up IRAF.

4)	To access the help files, simply type

	help <redshift directory pathname>/xcor.hlp file+		OR
	help <redshift directory pathname>/fquot.hlp file+
