This directory contains the "master" version of the standard, two channel
version of PLUCY (V0.65) as well as the stable ACOADD code (V1.4). 

These were updated in July 1995 to correct bugs and it is
strongly recommended that the new versions be obtained and implemented.

The files compile_acoadd and compile_plucy contain templates for 
building these application to run under IRAF. These files should be
edited to give the local locations for the STSDAS V77/VOS library.
Once this is done they may simply be executed to compile and link.

Please let me know any problems or suggestions you may have.
