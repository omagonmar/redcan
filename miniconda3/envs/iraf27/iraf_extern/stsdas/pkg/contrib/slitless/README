To use slitless as a standalone program, you must first declare where
you installed the program using:
	$set slitless =  home$where_ever/
	task  slitless =  slitless$slitless.e

Slitless attempt to use the rspectext task from the noao onedspec
package.  Make sure that it is loaded prior to running Slitless.
