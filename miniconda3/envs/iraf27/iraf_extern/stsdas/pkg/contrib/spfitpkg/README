--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to Version 8.0
	*  Read the file NewinSpecfit8 for a list of all the new features in
	   specfit.  This include an improved minimization routine, improved
	   functionality in the interactive mode, two new specfit tasks, and
	   several new component types - to name a few.

Installation
	* Install all three specfit tasks - specfit, dbcheck, dbcreate.  All 
	  three are defined in the executable file created by compiling 
	  specfit (xx_specfit.e).  A typical task installation looks like

		task specfit dbcheck dbcreate = specfit$xx_specfit.e

	  where the environment variable "specfit" has been previously
	  defined to point to the specfit code directory, e.g.

		set specfit="/home/perseus/gak/specfit8/"

	* Global definitions are contained in "specfit.h".  Make changes to
	  array sizes here if necessary.
	* the "mkpkg" file may need to be tailored to your specific site.
	  See the IRAF manuals for appropriate instructions and examples.
	* For installation of the three "help" files, see instructions 
	  for the IRAF command "mkhelpdb"
	* Before running specfit make sure to look at the parameter file 
	  specfit.par.  Make sure that the variable key_file which 
	  describes the location of the specfit.key file is defined correctly.

Adding additional fitting functions of your own

	This entails modifications to several routines, but is not complex.
	The files involved are

	fspec.x	- add your new procedure here near the bottom of the file
		- declare the procedure in "procedure cspec"
		- add variables as necessary to cspec
		- add a new case statement in cspec

	sfinitcomp.x - add the name of the new component and its number of
		parameters to the initializations here.

	specfit.h - increase the value of "NKEYS" by one

	Optional:  look at sfaddcomp.x and dbcreate.x to see if you would like
		to add prompts for your new components to these files.  Both 
		files contain more information in them as commented text.

	Re-compile with mkpkg.
