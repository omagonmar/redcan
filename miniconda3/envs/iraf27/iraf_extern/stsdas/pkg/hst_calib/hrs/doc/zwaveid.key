        ' ' <space>
            Hitting  the  <space>  key  will  return the location of the
            cursor in both wavelength and pixel space.  The form of  the
            output is:
            
                    wave=XXXXX pixel=XXXXX
        
        ':' Start  a  colon  command.   See  below  for  list  of  colon 
            commands.
        
        'a' Plot all  the  spectra.   The  observational  spectrum,  the
            predicted  artificial  spectrum,  and the located artificial
            spectrum are all plotted.  A key on the right of  the  graph
            indicate what type of line corresponds to each spectrum.
        
        'b' Plot  both  artificial  spectra.   Both  the  predicted  and 
            located  artificial  spectra  are  plotted,   omitting   the 
            observational  spectrum.   A  key  on the right of the graph
            indicites what type of line corresponds to each spectrum.
        
        'g' Get information  on  the  line  whose  located  position  is
            nearest  the  graphics  cursor.   The  following  message is
            returned:
            
            
                    line xxxx located at pixel xxx wavelength xxxx
            
                    where   'line xxxx' is the line's known wavelength
                            'pixel xxx' is the pixel position of the line
                            'wavelength xxx' is the wavelength of that pixel as
                            determined by the provided wavelength solution
        
        'i' Identify a line.  The use of the 'i' key  is  a  three  step
            process.   It  is  best to use the 'i' key when the observed
            spectrum  and   predicted   line   spectrum   are   plotting 
            simultaneously, (see the 'p' key').
            
            The  first  time the 'i' key is hit, instructions on the use
            of the 'i' key are printed:
            
                    Select observed feature to identify
            
            Place the graphics cursor  on  a  feature  in  the  observed
            spectrum  that  will  be  identified,  then  hit the 'i' key
            again.  The following instruction is printed:
            
                    Select line associated with feature
            
            Place the graphics cursor on the feature  in  the  predicted
            spectrum  and  hit  the 'i' key again.  The selected feature
            will be associated with the  selected  line,  determining  a
            new   zero-point  offset.   The  locating  phase  will  then 
            re-execute,  determining  new  locations  for  lines.    The 
            zero-point  offset  calculated  can  be  queired  using  the 
            "offset" colon command.
        
        'l' Plot the observational spectrum and the  located  artificial
            spectrum.   A  key  to the right of the plot indicates which
            plot refers to which spectum.
        
        'n' Next spectrum.  The accept the line locations found for  the
            current  spectrum  and  start  processing the next.  This is
            the same functionality as the 'q' and EOF keys.
        
        'p' Plot predicted and observed spectra.  A key to the right  of
            the  graph  indicates  which  line type corresponds to which
            spectrum.
        
        'q' Next spectrum.  The accept the line locations found for  the
            current  spectrum  and  start  processing the next.  This is
            the same functionality as the 'n' and EOF keys.
        
        'r' Redraw.  Simply redraw the graphs.
        
        's' Silent.  Accept the line locations of the  current  spectrum
            and  end  interactive mode.  If there are more spectra to be
            processed, they will be done without graphics interaction.
        
        'w' Execute the gtool windowing options.  Refer to the help  for
            'gtools'  for  more information.  The next key may be one of
            the following:
            
            'a' Autoscale x and y axes.
            
            'b' Set bottom edge of window.
            
            'c' Center window at cursor position.
            
            'd' Shift window down.
            
            'e' Expand window (mark lower left and upper  right  of  new
                window)
            
            'f' Flip x axis.
            
            'g' Flip y axis.
            
            'j' Set left edge of window.
            
            'k' Set right edge of window.
            
            'l' Shift window left.
            
            'm' Autoscale x axis.
            
            'n' Autoscale y axis.
            
            'p' Pan x and y axis about cursor.
            
            'r' Shift window right.
            
            't' Set top edge of window.
            
            'u' Shift window up.
            
            'x' Zoom x axis about cursor.

        'x' Recalculate zero-point offset with cross correlation.
        
        EOF Next  spectrum.  The accept the line locations found for the
            current spectrum and start processing  the  next.   This  is
            the same functionality as the 'n' and 'q' keys.
        
        Below is the list of colon commands available.
        
        no_dups [yes/no]
            Show/change   state   of   no_dups.    If  'yes',  only  the 
            "brightest" lines, as determined by  the  line  list  table,
            will  be  allowed  at the same pixel location.  If 'no', all
            lines located are allowed, despite the fact  that  some  may
            be   assigned   to  the  same  observed  feature.   With  no 
            argument, the current state is reported.
        
        offset [value]
            Show/set value of the zero-point offset.  The units  of  the
            offset  should  first be set using the "units" colon command
            (see below).   With  no  argument,  the  current  offset  is
            displayed.
        
        radius [value]
            Show/set  number  of  pixels  to search around the predicted
            pixel  position  for  a  feature.   With  no  argument,  the 
            current value is displayed.
        
        sigma [value]
            Show/set   value   of   sigma   for  artificially  generated 
            spectra.  If an argument is provided, it  is  taken  as  the
            sigma  of the gaussian used to create the artificial spectra
            based on the predicted/located positions of lines.  With  no
            argument, the current value is displayed.
        
        thresh [value]
            Show/set  threshold  for  true  observed  features.   If  an 
            observed emission has peak flux less  than  this  value,  it
            will  not  be  used.  With no argument, the current value is
            displayed.
        
        units [wavelength,pixel,sample]
            Show/set the units of  the  zero-point  offset.   The  units
            should  be  set  before  the  offset  is  specified with the
            "offset" colon  command.   With  no  argument,  the  current
            units are displayed.
        
        width [value]
            Show/set  feature  width size.  With argument, reset feature
            width size.  With no argument, report on current size.
        
        xcor [yes/no]
            Show/set whether cross-correlation should be  used  to  find
            the  initial  zero-point offset.  'yes' will recalculate the
            zero-point offset before the lines are located.   'no'  will
            use  the  offset  specified  by  the "offset" command or the
            value specified initially in the  "offset"  task  parameter.
            This  command has no effect on the current spectrum; it will
            only effect  subsequent  spectra.   With  no  argument,  the
            current state will be displayed.
