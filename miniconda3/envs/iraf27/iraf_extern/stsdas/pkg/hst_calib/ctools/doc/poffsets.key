The following key commands are available to change the shift
calculated:

?	Help:  List of the available cursor key commands.

d	Delete Shift:  This key undefines the shift for the current
	correlation.  If the correlation is one of many sections for the
	current spectrum, it will not be included in the final shift
	average.  If this is the only section for a spectrum, no shift
	will be output for the spectrum.  An informational message
	will be displayed indicating that no shift for this section is
	present. 

m	Mark New Shift:  The shift is set to the X-position of the graphics
	cursor, with quadratic refinement.  A line will appear, called
	"current" at the new location of the current shift.

n	Go To Next Section:  If there is more than one section
	specified for the current spectrum, this key will go to the
	next section.  If there is only one section (the default),
	this key has no effect. 

p	Go To Previous Section:  If there is more than one section
	specified for the current spectrum, this key will go to the
	previous section.  If there is only one section (the default),
	this key has no effect. 

q or EOF character
	Go To The Next Correlation:  If there are more sections for
	the current spectrum, the next section correlation is
	displayed.  If there are no more sections, the first section
	of the next spectrum is displayed.  If all the spectra have
	been processed, the task ends, writing the shifts to the
	output table. 

r	Restore Original Shift:  Resets the shift for the current
	correlation to the same value as was originally calculated,
	i.e., the shift marked by the line labeled "initial".

s	Show Cursor Coordinates:  This just echoes the current
	location of the graphics cursor.  There is no effect on the
	calculated shifts.
