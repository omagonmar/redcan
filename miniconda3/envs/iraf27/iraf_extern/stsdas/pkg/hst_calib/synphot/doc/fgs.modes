FGS

The FGS instrument keywords consist of a list of filters plus a dispersion
axis. Some of the filter names are aliases for other filters: "astroclear" is
an alias for "F605W", "clear" is an alias for "F583W", "red" is an alias for
"F650W", and "yellow" is an alias for "F550W". One example of an FGS
observation mode string would be "FGS,F583W,Y".

Filter: f550w (yellow) f583w (clear) f605w (astro-clear) f650w (red) nd5 pupil
