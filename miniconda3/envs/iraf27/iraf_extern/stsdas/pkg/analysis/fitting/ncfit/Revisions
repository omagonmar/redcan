<Busko 14-OCT-97>

Added support for multiple minimization algorithms.



<Busko 26-FEB-96>

Major modification to include minimization in chi-square instead of r.m.s. 



<Busko 12-JUL-90>

Modified to overlay on top of modified nlfit library (with 2-dim 
capability). Modified files: icdeviant.x, icfit.x, icgaxes.x, 
icgfit.x, icggraph.x, icgparams.x, icvshow.x



<Busko 11-JUN-90>

Modified cursor keystrokes for enabling gaussians with linear slope 
baseline. Modified files: icgfit.x, icgfit.key, icgcolon.x,names.h, 
icggraph.x



<Busko 23-MAY-90>

Added a colon command to enable manipulation of the user function string. 
Added colon commands to show/modify the simplex control parameters alpha, 
beta and gamma. Modified files: icgcolon.x, icgfit.key



<Busko 7-MAR-90>

Fixed bugs related to plotting magnitude of negative values, and incorret 
deletion/undeletion of points in mag scale. A new cursor routine (icgcursor.x) 
was created. The mag scale no longer works whith elog, but whith the regular
log10 instead. Modified files: icfit.h, names.h, mkpkg, icgcursor.x, 
icggraph.x, icgdelete.x, icgundelete.x, icgfit.x



<Busko 9-FEB-90>

The x axis label and units are set according whith the physical units 
defined in the nlfit library. Modified files: icggraph.x



<Busko 9-FEB-90> 

Two types of data plotting are allowed: continuous line or markers. The 
markers are square boxes whith y error bars. The errors are assumed to be 
the inverse of the data weights. A new colon command was added to allow 
user selection of this option. Modified files: icfit.h, icggraph.x, 
icparams.x, icgfit.key



<Busko 7-FEB-90>

Three types of axis are allowed: linear, log and magnitude (linear and log 
in x). Colon commands were added to allow setting/listing the associated 
parameters. A new parameter and colon command were added in order to provide 
a constant for the magnitude scale. Modified files: icfit.h, icggraph.x, 
icgaxes.x, icparams.x, icgfit.key



<Busko 5-FEB-90>

New GALPROF function type was included. Modified files: icgfit.key, 
icgcolon.x, icfit.h



<Busko 15-SEP-89>

Cursor help file now contains a description of the ordering of function 
coefficients fore each functional form. Modified files: icgfit.key



<Busko 20-JUL-89>

New CGAUSS function type was included. Modified files: icgfit.x, 
icggraph.x, icgcolon.x, icfit.h, names.h



<Busko 28-APR-89>
Modifications in several routines were made in order to incorporate two 
new function types: (i) sum of two black-bodies; (ii) user-specified 
function. Modified files:ncfit



<Busko  2/25/89>

Corrected marker size calculation when plotting averaged ranges. Previous 
calculation plotted symbols with correct size only when x axis was in pixel 
units. Modified files: icggraph.x
