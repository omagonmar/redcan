Non-linear least squares curve fitting package.

Contains routines to fit functions non-linear in their parameters, in the least
squares sense, to 1 or 2-dimensional data. 

The package contains separate entry points for setting the function parameter's
initial guesses, fitting, evaluating the curve and rejecting data points.
