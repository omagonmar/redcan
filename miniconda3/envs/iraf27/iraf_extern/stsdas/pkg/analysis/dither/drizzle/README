DRIZZLE V1.2 & BLOT V0.6

An IRAF task for variable-pixel linear reconstruction (drizzling)
and a support task (blot) for the reverse operation.

Andy Fruchter & Richard Hook, 2nd March 1998

*** Note - this is a new version of DRIZZLE which differs in   ***
*** several minor ways from the previous release (V1.1).       ***
*** Please read the RELEASE_NOTES_V1.2 files carefully.        ***

This compressed tar file (drizzle1.2+blot0.6.tar.Z) contains the third 
public release of the "drizzle" image reconstruction task along
with the second release of the "blot" support task. Drizzle was developed
for the combination of the Hubble Deep Field HST/WFPC2 data and is
primarily intended for the processing of "dithered" imaging data. A
description of the method is available at:

 http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/dither/

Blot is an implementation of "reverse drizzling" which can be used
when combining dithered multiple frames and also detecting and flagging
cosmic ray events. Please consult the Web for more details. Blot is
likely to be less widely used than Drizzle and you may wish to remove the
blot files and not install it.

These versions of Drizzle and Blot are identical to those released within
the STSDAS "dither" package.

The software consists of two IRAF tasks and is distributed as F77 source code.
Also supplied are coefficient files used by the tasks for the removal
of geometrical distortion from HST/WFPC2 and STIS CCD images, and IRAF 
format help files. Instructions for installation are found in the INSTALL 
file within the distribution.

The first step is to select a directory where the tasks are to be installed.
Then the distribution file must be unpacked using the following commands
which should be valid on most UNIX systems:

uncompress drizzle1.2+blot0.6.tar.Z
tar xvf drizzle1.2+blot0.6.tar

There should be 17 files (excluding the distribution tar file) along with a 
directory called "coeffs" which contains five files of geometric 
distortion files for HST/WFPC2 and STIS-CCD and a README.

Please now follow the instructions in the file INSTALL and read the
RELEASE_NOTES_V1.2 carefully.

Happy drizzling (and maybe blotting as well)!
