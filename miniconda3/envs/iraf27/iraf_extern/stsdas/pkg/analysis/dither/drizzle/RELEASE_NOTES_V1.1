Release Notes for DRIZZLE V1.1 & BLOT 0.5

Richard Hook & Andy Fruchter, 12th May 1997

V1.1 is the first public release of Drizzle since the initial
release (V1.02 September 1996). This file lists the changes which
have been introduced. The additional task Blot (V0.5) is also
included in this release for the first time.

New Parameters:

DRIZZLE V1.1 has three additional parameters. As a result users
must "unlearn drizzle" before using the new version. The new
parameters have the following meanings:

"shft_fr" defines the coordinate system in which the shifts are
applied. It may take the value "input" or "output". The default is "input"
which means that the shifts are applied in the input frame before
any rotation. Note that the default in V1.02, although not stated
explicitly, was "output".

"align" is a new option which defines the precise mapping of pixels
from input to output. If this is set to "center", and the input
shift is set to then the center of
pixel (Nx/2+1,Ny/2+1) in the input image maps onto the center of
pixel (Mx/2+1,My/2+1) in the output. (Nx,Ny) and (Mx,My) are the 
sizes of the dimensions of the input and output images respectively.
The division by two is done using integer arithmetic (i.e. rounding 
down). This behaviour is now the default and was
the behaviour in V1.02 under all circumstances. The alternative
"align=corner" maps the corner (Nx/2+0.5,Ny/2+0.5) onto 
(Mx/2+0.5,My/2+0.5). This is intended to allow Drizzle to be used
to do "block replication" of data.
"align=center" with a small "pixfrac" may be used for interlacing of
data points. 

"out_un" is a new option to allow the units of the output data images
to be "counts-per-second" (cps) rather than counts. In V1.02 the 
results were always in counts if the inputs were not specially scaled.
Note that successive runs of Drizzle should always use same
value of this parameter.

Other Changes:

o The scaling of the weight file has been changed so
  that a weight of N in an input pixel contributes a total of N to the 
  output weight image (assuming the input pixel maps entirely to within
  the output weights image).  So that, again assuming that all of the
  input images are entirely mapped into the output, the sum of all the
  pixels in the output weight image is equal to the sum of all the pixels
  in the input weight images.

o A new option (coeffs=header) has been added which allows Drizzle to 
  automatically select the correct geometrical distortion coefficients and
  wavelengths for WFPC2 images using the header values.  When this option
  is invoked, the value of the input parameter lambda is ignored.   
  We suggest that this option be used when removing geometric distortion
  from WFPC2 images. 
  
o A new option allows images to be weighted by the square of exposure
  time rather than the exposure time. This is appropriate
  for read-noise dominated exposures and is selected setting wt_scl=
  expsq.

o The header keywords put into the output images have been modified to allow
  a maximum of 999 images to be drizzled onto the same output. The
  previous limit was 99. This change means that V1.1 will not recognize
  the header keywords in images created by previous versions (this, however,
  does not have any serious consequences). 

o Some modifications have been made to reduce the memory requirements,
  particularly for large input images.

o Some utilities have been separated from the main "drizzle.f" module
  into the file "drutil.f".

o A bug which caused crashes due to uninitialized WCS variables has been
  fixed. 

o The Blot reverse-drizzling task has been included.
