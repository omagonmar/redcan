Release Notes for V2.6 of Drizzle

Richard Hook, ST-ECF, October 2001
Minor update, December 2001

The previous public release of the Drizzle software was V1.41.
This note briefly describes the new features introduced since
then.

Important - this version introduces two new parameters and a 
new pset (outcont, kernel and dr2gpar). Although the default
values of these will result in the same behavior as Drizzle
1.41 (ie, outcont="", kernel="square" and dr2gpar set to the
default, indentity) it is recommended that you "unlearn drizzle"
and check any script you may have to include the new parameters.

This version should also be used in conjunction with the matching
tools - Blot, Traxy, Tranback and Wcs2dr (V1.0 in all cases).

The three main new Drizzle features are Context Images, Multiple
Kernel support and Secondary Geometric Parameters. These will be 
briefly described here by quoting the relevant parts of the help
file for Drizzle The user is also referred to the article in the 
ST-ECF Newsletter, Number 28, page 4 
(http://www.stecf.org/newsletter/stecf-nl-28.pdf).

Context Images:

    Versions 2.6 and later of Drizzle include the capability to  produce
    so-called  "context"  images  as  an  optional data product. Context
    images encode information about which input image contributes  to  a
    specific  output  pixel.  This  is done using a simple bitmask where
    "bit set" means that that image, in the order  they  were  combined,
    contributed  with non- zero weight to that output pixel. The context
    image starts as a 32bit integer but  is  extended  as  a  cube  with
    additional 32 bit deep planes as required.

    Context   images   are  intended  to  allow  the  reconstruction  of
    information  about  the  input  images  which   contributed   to   a
    particular output pixel.  For many purposes they will not be needed.

    Output context images are selected in the same way as output weight
    ones - in this case set the parameter "outcont" to the name for
    the output context image. If it exists it will be updated.

Multiple Kernels:

    Versions  2.6  and  later of Drizzle include an additional parameter
    "kernel" which determines the form  of  the  kernel  function  which
    distributes  weight  in the output. The original classical drizzling
    corresponds  to  "kernel=square".  Currently  available   additional
    options for the value of "kernel" are:

       "point"      the kernel is a point so each input pixel
                    can only contribute to the single pixel which is
                    closest to the output position. It is equivalent
                    to the limit pixfrac -> 0. It is very fast.

       "gaussian"   the kernel is a circular gaussian with FWHM equal
                    to the value of pixfrac, measured in input pixels.

       "turbo"      this is similar to kernel="square" but the box is
                    always the same shape and size on the output grid and
                    always aligned with the X and Y axes. This results
                    in a significant speed increase in some cases.

       "tophat"     the kernel is a circular "top hat" shape of width
                    pixfrac. In effect only output pixels within pixfrac/2
                    of the output position are affected.

    It should be noted that none of these new kernels have been extensively
    tested and they should be used with care. If in doubt stick with the
    default.

Secondary Geometric Parameters:

    When  combining dithered images one normally begins by measuring the
    offsets between all the images in a set  so  that  one  can  combine
    them.  However, quite often one then needs to apply a transformation
    to the result - for example a  small  "tweak"  in  X,Y  or  a  large
    rotation  to  put  north  at  the  top. It is very tricky to combine
    these  two  operations  by  directly  modifying  the  drizzle  input
    parameters,  particularly  if  rotations  are present. To ease these
    operations  the  secondary  geometric  parameter   pset   has   been
    introduced  in  Drizzle V2.6. It is called "dr2gpar" (DRizzle 2ndary
    Geometrical PARameters) and may be set either using  "epar  dr2gpar"
    or  via  the  ":e"  command  from  the  dr2gpar line whilst in "epar
    drizzle".

    The parameters and their default values are:

    dr2gpar.xscale = 1.
    dr2gpar.yscale = 1.
    dr2gpar.xsh = 0.
    dr2gpar.ysh = 0.
    dr2gpar.rot = 0.
    dr2gpar.shft_fr = "output"

    Other parameters are in two groups: xscale/yscale and  the  rest.  The
    scaling  parameters  are  applied on the original pixel grid, before
    distortion   correction   or   the   primary   linear    geometrical
    transformations.   This  is  really a "tweak" for rare occasions and
    should not normally be used.

    The four remaining parameters define a shift and rotation  which  is
    applied  after  all  other  geometrical  transformations.  They  are
    defined in the same was as the  primary  geometrical  parameters  of
    the same name.

    If  these  parameters  are  set  to anything other than the defaults
    Drizzle will write out a  warning  message  to  prevent  them  being
    forgotten about.

    The secondary geometrical parameters pset dr2gpar is also used by the
    other tasks (specifically Blot, Traxy and Tranback).

Additional Changes since V1.41.

A bug on WCS updating in the case of the CD matrix being diagonal
and no rotation being applied was corrected - this had led to an
incorrect error message and wrong output WCS.

The code has been re-organised to improve it a little, although
there is still much room for further improvement! More routines
are now in the support "drutil.f" file. All geometric transformations
are carried out by the same routine.

Users should also note that companion tasks - Blot, Traxy, Tranback and Wcs2dr
(all now in version 1.0) are also available. These now all share the same
interface library and are fully compatible.
