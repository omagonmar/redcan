September 2004

This public release of the Drizzle software, Version 3.32, has been reorganized
in order to simultaneously support installations under IRAF and Python, while
including many bug fixes and upgrades from Version 2.92.  In addition, the new
task 'wdrizzle' has been added to the package as well.

This version of drizzle introduces two new parameters:
    xgeoim, ygeoim
These parameters allow the user to specify separate additional distortion
correction images that provide non-linear corrections to any distortion model
specified in the 'coeffs' file.  Although the default value for these will be
blank and these are strictly optional, it is recommended that you 'unlearn
drizzle' and check any script you may have to include the new parameters.

This version also contains the matching tools: 
    WDrizzle, WBlot, Blot, Traxy, Tranback, dr2geo, and Wcs2dr.
