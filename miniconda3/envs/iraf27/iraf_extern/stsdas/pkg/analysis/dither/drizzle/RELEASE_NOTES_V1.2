Release Notes for Drizzle V1.2 & Blot V0.6

Richard Hook & Andy Fruchter, 2nd March 1998

V1.2 is in a minor upgrade of Drizzle released to coincide with
the release of Drizzle and Blot within the STSDAS "dither" package.
This file lists the minor changes which have been introduced. 
The additional task Blot (V0.6) is also released in compatible form
to work with Drizzle V1.2.

Parameter changes:

Drizzle V1.2 has a new additional parameter and one of the Drizzle
V1.1 parameters has been withdrawn. As a result users must "unlearn 
drizzle" before using the new version. Blot has a single new
parameter. The parameters changes are as follows:

"in_un" is a new option to allow the units of the input data images
to be "counts-per-second" (cps) rather than counts. This is mainly to
allow processing of NICMOS images which are supplied in these units.
This parameter is in both Drizzle and Blot.

The "exp_sc" parameter in Drizzle V1.1 has been removed. Images are now
always scaled by exposure time (except when the input is already in CPS)
before combination. This means that the exposure time now must be present
in the header.

Other Changes:

o A cubic distortion coefficients set for the STIS CCD has been supplied.
 
o Some modules have been separated from the main "drizzle.f" module
  into the file "drutil.f".

o The WCS is now properly updated independent of the functional form
  of the geometric transform (previous versions worked correctly
  on the WFPC2 distortion, but did not include a general solution for
  the WCS transform.)
