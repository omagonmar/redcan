This directory contains text files specifying the geometrical
distortion coefficients derived by John Trauger and colleagues 
for the WFPC2 camera chips. They are suitable for use with the
DRIZZLE program.

In release V1.2 of Drizzle an additional cubic distortion file
called "stis-ccd" is also included for the HST/STIC CCD imaging mode.
