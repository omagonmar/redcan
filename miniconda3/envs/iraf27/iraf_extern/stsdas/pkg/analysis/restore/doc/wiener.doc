FOURIER NONITERATIVE IMAGE RESTORATION

.sh
1. INTRODUCTION

Fourier noniterative image restoration techniques have as their main
advantage the short computation time they need to produce a solution,
when compared with more elaborate iterative restoration methods. Also,
they are strictly linear by design. The reason behind that computational
efficiency lies in the fact that the computations are made in the Fourier
transform domain, where the 2-D matrix operations needed for inverting the
imaging equation are expressible as 1-D vector-only operations. Also, the
existence of very efficient FFT algorithms adds to the overall efficiency
of the technique.

The Wiener filter approach tries to build an "optimal" estimate of the
original, undegraded image, by enforcing a minimum mean-square-error
constraint between estimate and original images, under the assumption of
adequate spatial sampling and signal-independent noise [1]. A less strict
least-squares deviation criterion leads to the usual inverse filter. Under
the minimum mean-square-error constraint, the filter assumes a functional
form that involves essentially the blur matrix (PSF) and the original
image and noise autocorrelation matrices. Here we come to the first
problem: besides knowledge about the PSF, some a priori knowledge about
the original, undegraded image itself must be available, in order to
perform the restoration. This knowledge is unecessary in the case of
inverse filter, since it depends only on the PSF matrix. However, its
ill-conditioned behavior limits its use to very high signal-to-noise ratio
images.

For the most general case, a matrix inversion with size of the order of
N**2, where N is the number of pixels in the image, is required. This is
clearly an unfeasible task for reasonabily sized images, unless
simplifications can be found. Additional assumptions and approximations
about the structure of the original, undegraded image, as well as the PSF
nature, must be done.

The first approximation is to assume a spatially-invariant PSF. This
introduces so-called block-Toeplitz structure in the PSF matrix. A second
approximation is to assume that inter-pixel correlation is negligible
beyond a certain distance between pixels. Most important, however, is the
additional assumption that the image structure (texture) can be modelled
by a wide-sense stationary stochastic process; that is, a process whose
autocorrelation function is invariant with respect to spatial coordinate
translations. Also, constant mean must be assumed for this process. Under
all these assumptions, the autocorrelation matrices will also show
block-Toeplitz structure similar to the PSF matrix. For large sizes,
Toeplitz and block-Toeplitz matrices can be approximated by circulant and
block-circulant matrices, respectively. Since circulant matrices are
readily diagonalized by the Fourier transform matrix (that is, the Fourier
transform coefficients are the eingenvalues of a circulant [2]), the
problem reduces to a scalar inversion in the Fourier transform domain,
subject to a constraint dictated by the image and noise second-order
statistics. Notice that the circulant approximation is equivalent to
assuming periodicity in the image and PSF matrices.

Now lets resume the approximations adopted in deriving the
fast-computation Wiener restoration:
.ls (1)
Image and noise are wide-sense stationary with constant mean. Their
autocorrelation functions are known a priori.
.le
.ls (2)
PSF is spatially invariant.
.le
.ls (3)
Image and PSF are periodic.
.le
.ls (4)
PSF is not undersampled.
.le
.ls (5)
Noise is signal-independent.
.le

In the case of HST images, none of these assumptions are completely
satisfied. In particular, a typical astronomical image shows regions with
very different correlation functions: nearby a star image, inter-pixel
correlation is very high; in sky background regions correlation is low.
In other words, the stationarity hypothesis does not apply to those
images. This is the main reason why Wiener filter restorations look of
lower quality than more expensive methods, which in some way take into
account the spatially variant image statistics. Of course, a spatially
variant PSF and significant undersampling (as e.g. in the WF/PC) 
also contribute to the
lower restoration quality atainable with Wiener restoration.

Another Wiener filter drawback comes directly from the minimum
mean-square-error constraint. It is known from psychophysics that the
human eye is not a minimum mean-square-error detector. The eye is willing
to accept more noise than allowed for by the Wiener filter, provided this
noise is spatially associated with sharp intensity changes. The
stationarity hypothesis plus the minimum mean-square-error constraint
result in restored images having an unpleasantly smooth look.

Nevertheless, experience with a limited number of HST images (mostly 
pre-COSTAR FOC
f/96, where the PSF may be assumed to be spatially invariant, and is
adequately sampled) has shown that acceptable restorations can be atained
by the Wiener filter. For WF/PC images, lower quality results must be
expected, of course. The main advantage over iterative methods is
execution speed. In a Sparc 2, a 512 X 512 image may take 10-15 CPU
minutes to be deconvolved by the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, while the same
image is restored in 50-90 CPU seconds by the Wiener filter. One
may think of the Wiener filter 
as a "quick-look" tool, capable of producing acceptable (not the best
possible) restorations in a very short time, while the final restoration
is performed by a costlier iterative algorithm.

2. FILTER IMPLEMENTATION

The most general filter implementation may be written as in [1]:
.nf

G(u,v) = F(u,v) * (I(u,v) ** alpha) * (W(u,v) ** (1.-alpha))

.fi
where G(u,v) is the estimated image Fourier transform, 
F(u,v) is the input, degraded image Fourier transform, 
I(u,v) is the inverse filter function,
W(u,v) is the Wiener filter function, and
alpha is a parameter. 
For alpha=0 we have the standard Wiener filter, and for alpha=1.
the standard inverse filter. By varying alpha between 0. and 1.
we may emphasize the relative effect of each filter. The so-called 
geometric mean filter is obtained setting alpha=0.5.
This geometric mean filter was introduced [1] as an attempt to
de-emphasize the low-frequency dominance of the Wiener filter,
while avoiding the early singularity of the inverse filter.

The inverse filter is simply:
.nf

             H*(u,v)
I(u,v) = ----------------
         (abs(H(u,v)))**2

.fi
and the Wiener filter is:
.nf

                        H*(u,v)
W(u,v) =  ---------------------------------------
          (abs(H(u,v)))**2  + (Pn(u,v) / Pg(u,v))

.fi
where
H(u,v) is the PSF Fourier transform, 
H*(u,v) its complex conjugate, 
Pn(u,v) is the noise power spectrum, and
Pg(u,v) the original, undegraded image, power spectrum
(u,v is spatial frequency).

.sh
3. SIGNAL AND NOISE MODELS

The a priori knowledge about the undegraded image manifests itself in the
Pg(u,v) and Pn(u,v) terms, which are essentially the Fourier transforms of
the image and noise autocorrelation functions, respectively. The STSDAS
implementation provides a range of choices for these image and noise models.
.sh
3.1 Noise

Noise is assumed to be white (that is Pn(u,v) = Pn = constant), and is
measured at a certain fixed frequency
.nf

fnoise = sqrt (u**2 + v**2)

.fi
in the image Fourier transform F(u,v), averaging the power in all (u,v)
pixels satisfying relation above.  If not supplied by the user, the
program uses the largest value of fnoise available. This assumes that, at
these large frequencies, signal power is negligible with respect to noise
power. Notice that this may not be true in the case of undersampled
images.

It is possible to introduce a modification in the Wiener filter
derivation, to take into account signal-dependent noise [3,4]. The STSDAS
implementation includes that modification, for the case of Poisson noise.
This usually produces, when applicable, slight, but noticeabily better
restorations, than the standard independent noise model.
.sh
3.2 Signal

For the undegraded image model Pg(u,v), the available options are:
.ls white
This is the simplest image model. Pg(u,v) is assumed to be constant
and equal to the average power in the input image.
.le
.ls input
A good bet is to assume that the input image power spectrum is a
reasonable estimate of the undegraded image power spectrum. The observed
image power spectrum may be written in terms of the original image, PSF
and noise, as:
.nf

Pf(u,v) =~ (abs(H(u,v)))**2 * Pg(u,v) + Pn(u,v)

.fi
After subtracting the noise contribution, Pg(u,v) may be estimated from
the observed Pf(u,v). Using directly H(u,v)**2 usually induces strong high
frequency noise in the solution. A better approach is to simply multiply
Pf(u,v) by a "correlation parameter" > 1, to correct for the effects of
H(u,v)**2.  This approach usually works well in terrestrial scenes with
small blurs, where image correlation is large. In a typical HST stellar
field scene, however, where the input image power spectrum is dominated by
the PSF power spetrum, noticeable artifacts may be introduced in the
restoration.
.le
.ls Markov
It is known that, for terrestrial scenes, a first-order Markov stochastic
process is a good model for the image structure (texture) [5]. In such a
process, the autocorrelation matrix depends only on nearest-neighbor pixel
correlation. The program measures average inter-pixel correlation in the
input image and builds Pg(u,v) as a (circularly symmetric) Markov
spectrum. This usually produces the best restorations in terrestrial
scenes. In HST images there is a tendency to strongly low-pass filter the
image. This is because the average inter-pixel correlation in a scene
dominated by sky background is very small. Under such conditions, the
computed Markov spectrum will show very low powers at high spatial 
frequencies, thus strongly de-emphasizing these frequencies. The
geometric filter form is a useful compromise in compensating that behavior.
.le
.ls Gaussian
In some circunstances, we may be interested in restoring optimally some
specific structure in the image. In the particular case of HST stellar
fields, this particular structure may be a star image. We may adopt as
signal model the shape of such a star image; in the current
implementation, the adopted model is a Gaussian shape. Notice that this
will produce non-optimal restoration of the sky background, effectively
enhancing the high frequency noise in that background. Nevertheless, it
may be the best signal model when we are interested in restoring star
images in a crowded field with a minimum amount of contamination [6].  It
may be argued that the best model would be instead an Airy diffraction
pattern compatible with the telescope pupil characteristics. Experiments
with this image model showed an intolerable amount of "ringing" around
star images. This is because the noise suppression mechanism in the Wiener
filter introduces such ringing associated with abrupt intensity changes
[7]. This mechanism enhances the already present ring structure in the
diffraction pattern.
.le
.ls psf    
As a compromise between the Gaussian signal model, and the input image
signal model (for HST images), we may take the degraded star, that is, the
PSF itself, as signal model.
.le
.ls external image
In some circunstances, there may be available other images which belong to
the same "ensemble" as the image being restored. More specifically, an
external image with similar second-order statistics as the one being
restored is available. This image may be used as source for the signal
model Pg(u,v).
.le

There is one more implemented functional form for the Wiener filter, the
so called parametric filter. It completely ignores the points discussed
above, and uses as substitute for the term Pn(u,v)/Pg(u,v) a parameter
gamma. Small values of gamma will enhance the high frequency content on
the restored image; large values will enhance the low-pass filter
characteristics.  In the current implementation, the value of gamma input
by the user is actually multiplied by the average of Pn(u,v)/Pg(u,v), with
both power spectra measured in the input image. Gamma thus represents the
input image average noise-to-signal ratio in frequency space.

.sh
4. HINTS ON USAGE

First, the user must be aware that the restoration quality depends,
more than everything else, on the quality of the available PSF image.
This is related to the problem of so-called consistent convolutions [8].

Regarding signal model choice, the best approach when trying to deconvolve
an image for the first time is to leave all filter settings at their
default values. These include: ftype=Wiener, signalm=white (notice that
this is precisely the same filter generated by the combination
ftype=parametric, gamma=1.). Another suitable starting point could be
ftype=geometric, signalm=Markov. Both of these settings have the advantage
of being independent of any numerical input parameter, and are
representative of the "average" filter for the image being studied.

If the goal is to restore stellar images, the Gaussian signal model should
be tried. To minimize ringing around very bright stars, as well as sky
background noise, a mild (fwhm ~ 1.5 - 2 pixels) low-pass filter may be
useful. Another way to avoid ringing it is to resort to the inverse plus
low-pass filter [7]. However, stellar shapes will become more erratic
along the image.

For extended object restoration, a good bet is the ftype=geometric,
signalm=Markov model.

As a last comment, we must stress that most of the results obtained with
the more sophisticated signal models could be approximatelly arrived at by
the simpler parametric and pure inverse filters, if coupled to a suitably
chosen low-pass filter. The values of gamma and fwhm have to be chosen by
trial and error, until a "satisfactory" image is obtained.
This approach has two disadvantages relative to the more elaborate
filters: the results are only approximately equal; and, we do not know
precisely which criteria is being used for the restoration. In other
words, we do not know how far, and for which spatial structures and
frequencies, we are from the optimal minimum mean-square-error criterion.
