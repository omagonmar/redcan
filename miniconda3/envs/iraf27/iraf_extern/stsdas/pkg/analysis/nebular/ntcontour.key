		NTCONTOUR COLON COMMANDS

The colon commands take one argument and may be abbreviated.

:clist      [string]	Set the list of secondary contours
:diagtype   [string]	Set the diagnostic type (density|temperature)
:dmin	    [real]	Set the minimum density plot limit
:dmax	    [real]	Set the maximum density plot limit
:dscale	    [string]	Select log/linear plot scale for density 
:imin	    [real]	Set the minimum intensity plot limit
:imax	    [real]	Set the maximum intensity plot limit
:iscale	    [string]	Select log/linear plot scale for intensity 
:interval   [real]	Set the interval between contours
:ion        [int]	Set the ion
:ncontours  [int]	Set no. contours above/below the reference curve
:plottype   [string]	Set the type of plot: TN, IN, IT
