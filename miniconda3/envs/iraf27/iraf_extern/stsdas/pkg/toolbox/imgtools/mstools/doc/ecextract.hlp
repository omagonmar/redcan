DESCRIPTION
The 'ecextract' task is for simply selecting all extensions of a (1) selected
type into a different file.  There will be a display of types available for
selection before you have to provide your choice for selection.  You will be 
able to see, in real-time, the construction of your output file.

PARAMETERS
.ls INPUT [string]
A string listing the input FITS file from which you want to select a (1)
certain type of data extension.

This is a string which stores the name of the FITS file that is created.
.le
.ls EXTNAM [string]
A string specifying the extension type you wanted to uniquely select from the
input FITS file.  You must match one of the names that are listed as those
present in it's entirety.  This match is case sensitive.
.le
.ls OOPS [boolean]
This is a boolean expression test that is executed only when the output and

ramifications of your potential action and inquiring if you would like to

EXAMPLES
1. The 'ecextract' task is an easy way of grouping all of the file extensions 
you want into another FITS file and 'discarding' those you think you could 
do without.

ms> ecextract NICdata.fits NICSCI.fits SCI

This command will create a FITS file of ONLY the SCI extensions from the 
imsets that a NICMOS observation provides.

WARNING !!
You are able to request the same output name as your input name
and the task will comply with your request.  The danger is
that your input file WILL be OVERWRITTEN!  You will lose 
forever the contents of that input file as it is replaced
with the output.  You may want to do this but you should just 
be aware of the circumstance and reminded that you can choose
a different filename for your output.
