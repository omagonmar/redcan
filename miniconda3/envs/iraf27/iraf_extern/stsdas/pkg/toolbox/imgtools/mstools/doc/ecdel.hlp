PARAMETERS
.ls INPUT [string]
A string listing the FITS file from which you would like to remove an entire
'class' type from ALL of the imsets in the file.
.le
.ls OUTPUT [string]
This is a required parameter which may be the same name as the input file,
but should not be. In fact, if the same name is chosen the input file is
overwritten.
.le
.ls EXTNAM [string]
The name of the 'class' type you would like to remove.  You must match
one of the names that are listed as those present in it's entirety.

.le

remove the extensions that you asked.

WARNING !!
You are able to request the same output name as your input name
and the task will comply with your request.  The danger is
that your input file WILL be OVERWRITTEN!  You will lose 
forever the contents of that input file as it is replaced
with the output.  You may want to do this but you should just 
be aware of the circumstance and reminded that you can choose
a different filename for your output.

EXAMPLES
1. The ecdel task is easy to use in a harmless way, to your input data.  All
that is required is an input FITS file and the knowledge of what you want 
to do with it.

.nf
ms> ecdel IN=nicmosdata.fits OUT=data.noSAMP.fits EXTNAM=SAMP
.fi

A command like this will run, asking only for a y/n and showing you how your
output file is built, without the extension name SAMP.

2. The task can be run on the command line with all the required input for
the parameters or it will prompt you for everything that it needs.

.nf
ms> ecdel
.fi

And answer the following prompts.  A helpful listing of existing extensions is
provided to make answering the EXTNAM prompt much easier.
