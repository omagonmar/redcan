# Database of imexpr function information for NEWFIRM linearity correction
# 9/2/08:  Draft 1.2, MED
# 10/17/08:  Modified for coadds and explicit type cast
# 
#
# Apply linearity corrections to any NEWFIRM detector.  This version
# uses four functions, 'lc?', which are operate on the four NEWFIRM
# detectors.  It also includes the evaluation of the tcds and tr0
# functions within the imexpr database.  This simplifies the call and
# keeps various constants and array-dependent timing calculations
# within the database, rather than hardwiring them in the calling
# routine, but comes at the cost of slowing down execution somewhat.
#
# For the four NEWFIRM detectors (in extensions 1,2,3,4), the format
# of the imexpr call is (e.g.):
# imexpr "lc1(a,b)" out1.fits  a=image.fits[1] b=lincoeff.fits[1]
#     exprdb=newfirm_linearity_v1.2.db
# imexpr "lc2(a,b)" out2.fits  a=image.fits[2] b=lincoeff.fits[2]
#     exprdb=newfirm_linearity_v1.2.db
# imexpr "lc3(a,b)" out3.fits  a=image.fits[3] b=lincoeff.fits[3]
#     exprdb=newfirm_linearity_v1.2.db
# imexpr "lc4(a,b)" out4.fits  a=image.fits[4] b=lincoeff.fits[4]
#     exprdb=newfirm_linearity_v1.2.db
#

# where (e.g.) out1.fits is the result of the operation, a linearized
# version of the image, i.e., where the original signal level has
# been corrected for nonlinearity.  a = image.fits[1] is the image
# being corrected (in this example, one extension of an MEF) b =
# lincoeff.fits[1] is either an array of linearity coefficients
# (again, in this example, one extension of an MEF), or a single
# constant coefficient to be used for all pixels in the array

# Timing constants:

# Interval (seconds) between detector reset and first pixel readout
TR0=		0.0346
# Minimum interval (seconds) between end of 1 CDS readout and start of
# another
TR1=		0.0568
# Requested exposure time (from image header EXPTIME keyword)
TX=		exptime
# Number of Fowler Samples (from image header FSAMPLE keyword)
NFS=		fsample
# Number of Digital Averages (from image header DIGAVGS keyword)
NDA=		digavgs
# Number of coadds (from image header NCOADD keyword)
NCA=		ncoadd
# Requested exposure time per read (from image header EXPCOADD keyword)
TX1=		expcoadd

# Reset-to-1st-read time functions for four NEWFIRM detectors.  

# Time for a single readout of the detector in correlated double
# sampling (CDS) mode.  This is a function of the number of digital
# averages (NDA).
tcds		((NDA==1) ? 0.56 : 0.564+0.148*NDA)

# Baseline time constant for reset-to-1st-read, as a function of the
# single CDS read time (tcds) and the number of Fowler Samples (NFS):
tr0		(TR0+(tcds+TR1)*(NFS-1)/2)

# Functions to compute the reset-to-1st-readout time interval as a
# function of pixel position.  The four functions 'tr?' are used for
# the four NEWFIRM arrays, and take the detector readout orientations
# into account, based on the array configuration and FITS format used
# in 2008A.  Note that this will be different for 2007B data, where
# the arrangement of the detectors in the FITS images was different.

# For SN019 = im1, SE quadrant
tr1		(tr0+tcds*(J/2048.))
# For SN022 = im2, SW quadrant
tr2		(tr0+tcds*(2049.-I)/2048.)
# For SN013 = im3, NE quadrant
tr3		(tr0+tcds*(I/2048.))
# For SN011 = im4, NW quadrant
tr4		(tr0+tcds*(2049.-J)/2048.)

# Linearity correction functions for the four NEWFIRM detectors.  The
# calling imexpr routine would call one of these four functions (which
# in turn call the appropriate 'tr?' function) depending on the array
# being processed.
