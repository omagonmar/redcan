A suite of tasks for combining images.  The variants differ in their
default parameter values but are otherwise the same program.  They are also
variants of the core task <B>imcombine</B> with additional features for
handling multiextension files and for selection and grouping input lists
using keyword expressions.

<DD>List of input image files to combine.  These may be simple images
or multiextension format files (MEF).  For MEF files only the image
extensions are used.  All images must have the same dimensionality,
typically two-dimensional, though they may be of different sizes.
The input list may be filtered by the <I>select</I> parameter to select
only images satisfying a particular keyword expression.

<! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='output' Line='output'>
<DD>Output root filename for combined files or grouping lists.  Any image type
extension is removed and so the \Iimtype variable defines the ouutput
image type.  If there is no grouping, as defined by the <I>group</I>,
<I>seqval</I>, and <I>extension</I> expression parameters, then the output
will be a single file with the specified filename.  When grouping, a

<DD>Optional output mask file identifying rejected or excluded pixels.
The pixel mask is the size of the output image but there is one extra
dimension with length equal to the number of input images.  Each element
of the highest dimension is a mask corresponding to an input image with
values of 1 for rejected or excluded pixels and values of 0 for pixels

Since masks are integer, the exposure values may be scaled to preserve
dynamic range and fractional significance.  The scaling values are given in
the header under the keywords MASKSCAL and MASKZERO.  Exposure values are
computed from the mask values by scale * value + zero where scale is the

<! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='group' Line='group = "mkid(filter,1,1)"'>
<DD>A string-valued keyword expression used to group images.  All images

<DD>A numeric-valued keyword expression used to group images into sequences.
The images are sorted by the sequence value (after grouping by <I>group</I>
and <I>extension</I>) and then separated into sequences when the sequence
value between two images in the sorted order have a numeric separater
greater than the maximum gap size set by the <I>seqgap</I> parameter.

<DD>Type of combining operation performed on the final set of pixels (after
offsetting, masking, thresholding, and rejection).  The choices are
"<TT>average</TT>", "<TT>median</TT>", or "<TT>sum</TT>".  The median uses the average of the two central

The task <B>cgroup</B> provides only the parameters related to the selection
and grouping and produces lists of image files rather than combined images.
<P>
The images to be combined or grouped are specified by an input list
(<I>input</I>) of files from which a subset satisfying an optional boolean
keyword expression (<I>select</I>) may be selected.  The resulting set
of files may then be grouped (<I>group</I>, <I>seqval</I>, <I>extension</I>)
and each group combined or the filename written to a grouping list file.
When grouping, the output file names (<I>output</I>, <I>headers</I>,
<I>bpmasks</I>, <I>rejmasks</I>, <I>nrejmasks</I>, <I>expmasksfI,
fIsigmas</I>) may be used as root names with group identifiers appended
and the files may be multiextension files containing multiple images,
masks, or text blocks.
<P>
These tasks accept input which are multiextensions format (MEF)
files.  Only the image extensions are used.  In this case either
all the image extensions are combined or an output MEF file is created
with each <I>extension</I> group as an extension.
<P>
A group of images are combined by registering them in pixel space
(<I>offsets</I>) and making an output image which is either the maximum
overlap or a trimmed section (<I>outlimits</I>).  The overlapping pixels
may be scaled (<I>scale</I>, <I>zero</I>) and rejected (<I>masktype</I>,
<I>lthreshold</I>, <I>hthreshold</I>, <I>reject</I>).  The remaining overlapping
pixels are then summed, medianed, or weighted averaged (<I>combine</I>,
<I>weights</I>).  If all pixel are rejected or the output image size
includes regions with no overlapping images then a blank value (<I>blank</I>)
is output.
<P>
For combined images the output header is a copy of the first image in the
combined set.  In addition, the number of  images combined is recorded
under the keyword NCOMBINE.  The input image names which are combined
are also recorded under the indexed keywords IMCMBnnn provided there are
fewer than 100 images.  If a bad pixel mask is created, the name of the
mask will be included in the output image header under the keyword BPM.
The output pixel type is set by the parameter <I>outtype</I>.  If left
blank then the input datatype of highest precision is used.  If there is
a mixture of short and unsigned short images then the highest precision
is integer.
<P>
In addition to the output combined images various optional outputs include
header listings of the combined images (<I>headers</I>), bad pixel masks
(<I>bpmasks</I>) identifying regions with no input data, masks specifying
the number of pixels rejected and which pixels were rejected (<I>nrejmasks</I>,
<I>rejmasks</I>), the effective exposure time of each output pixel,
and the sigma of the combined pixels (<I>sigmas</I>).  Information about
the combining is also written to a log file (<I>logfile</I>) which may
be the terminal output or a text file.
<P>
<P>
INPUT SELECTION AND GROUPING WITH KEYWORD EXPRESSIONS
<P>
One may control the images to be combined explicitly with the input list.
In this case the selection and grouping parameters are set to null strings,
though when combining MEF files the xtension parameter may still be
needed to combining matching image extensions into an output MEF file.
<P>
The other way to control the images to be combined is through the four
keyword expression selection and grouping parameters <I>select</I>,
<I>group</I>, <I>seqval</I> and <I>extension</I>.  Before discussing these
we describe the general keyword expression syntax.  The use of these
expressions provides a more powerful alternative to translation files for
dealing with data from different observatories and instruments.
<P>
The variables in the expressions in these tasks are unquoted keyword
names whose values are to be used.  Expressions usually refer to a single
keyword but more complex combinations of keyword values may be used.  For a
generic discussion of expressions see the <B>expressions</B> help page.
Expressions may evaluate to strings, numbers, or booleans (true or false).
It is important to know what type of value an expression parameter must
produce.  Except for the <I>seqval</I> expression, keyword values are
automatically converted to strings so there is no need to cast keywords
with numeric values to strings.
<P>
The combining and grouping tasks provide three special functions.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_strmap">strmap(str,def,in1,out1,in2,out2,...)</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='strmap' Line='strmap(str,def,in1,out1,in2,out2,...)'>
<DD>Match "<TT>str</TT>" against each of the "<TT>in</TT>" strings.  When a match is found
output the corresponding "<TT>out</TT>" string.  If none match then output the
"<TT>def</TT>" string.
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_substr">substr(str,p1,p2)</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='substr' Line='substr(str,p1,p2)'>
<DD>Output the substring of "<TT>str</TT>" between character positions "<TT>p1</TT>" and "<TT>p2</TT>".
The positions are one-indexed.  Positions outside the string are
treated as null characters and if "<TT>p2</TT>" is less than "<TT>p1</TT>" a null string
is returned.
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_mkid">mkid(str,w1,w2)</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='mkid' Line='mkid(str,w1,w2)'>
<DD>Output the words between word positions "<TT>w1</TT>" and "<TT>w2</TT>".  The positions are
one-indexed.  The words are concatenated and any non-alphanumeric characters
<TT>'_'</TT> (underscore).
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
These functions are useful for grouping and setting the suffix strings
to be applied to the output rootname.  Note that "<TT>mkid</TT>" should be
used if there is a possiblity of whitespace or non-alphanumeric characters.
The functions can be imbedded within each other.
<P>
The <I>select</I>, <I>group</I>, and <I>seqval</I> expressions only use
keywords from the first image in an MEF file while the <I>extension</I>
expression applies to all extensions in an MEF and is not used for
single images.
<P>
The <I>select</I> expression must evaluate to a boolean.  Those input files
which evaluate to false are eliminated from the input list.  The typical
use of this parameter is to select exposures of a particular type such as
bias, dark, flat, or object.  The NOAO mosaic cameras identify the type
by an OBSTYPE.  The selection is often based on a string valued keyword
and the string matching syntax of expressions is used.
<P>
The <I>group</I> expression must evaluate to a string.  Any whitespace or
trailing period in the result are removed.  A group consists of all files
with the identical group value.  Because the group value is appended to
the output root name one should try and produce short but unique values.
The mkid functions is useful for this.  The common use for the group
parameter is to group dark exposure sequences by exposure time and flat
field and science exposures by filter.  Spectroscopic images would be
grouped by keywords related to the dispersion configuration.
<P>
The <I>seqval</I> expression must evaluate to a number.  After grouping
by the <I>group</I> and <I>extension</I> expressions the images in the
group are sorted by the sequence value.  The the sorted list is scanned
looking for increments in the sequence value greater than the value
given by the <I>seqgap</I> parameter.  When such a gap is found a new
sequence group is formed.  The sequence groups are numbered and the
number is appended to the output root name.  Obviously the purpose of
this parameter is to group a large set of input into sequences.  Typically
the sequences are calibration exposures (biases, darks, or dome flats)
and the interval between the sequences is usually a small amount.  The
sequence value is often a time.  If the time is cyclic special care
must be taken and a modified Julian date may be desireable.  Althernatively,
some data may have an explicit sequence number that is unique within a
sequence.  In this case the sequence number could be used with the
<I>group</I> parameter or with the sequence parameter using a gap value of
zero.
<P>
The <I>extension</I> expression, used only with MEF files, must evaluate
to a string.  An extension group consists of all files with the identical
value.  The use for the extension parameter is match extensions in MEF
files.  This is often done for data taken with a mosaic camera consisting
of multiple detectors or readout channels.  The matching may be done
with keywords unique to each channel which, in many cases, could be the
extension name.
<P>
OPTIONAL OUTPUTS
<P>
There are various additional outputs that may be produced by providing
the filenames.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_Headers">Headers</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='Headers' Line='Headers'>
<DD>The output image can only have one set of header keywords which are
inherited from the first input image in the input list.  Copies of all the
input headers may be stored in a multiextension FITS file specified by the
<I>headers</I> parameter.  The extension names are the input image names.
The extensions are dataless headers.  Since this means the image sizes are
lost, AXLEN keywords are added.  Also the keywords INIMAGE and OUTIMAGE are
added giving the name of the input image and the name of the output
combined image.
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_Bad">Bad Pixel Masks</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='Bad' Line='Bad Pixel Masks'>
<DD>The <I>bpmasks</I> parameter produces optional output bad pixel mask(s) with
good values of 0 and bad values of 1.  Output pixels are marked as bad when
no input pixels contributed to the output pixel.  The file name is also
added to the output image header under the keyword BPM.
</DD>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_Rejection">Rejection Masks</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='Rejection' Line='Rejection Masks'>
<DD>The <I>rejmasks</I> parameter produces optional output mask file(s)
identifying rejected or excluded pixels.  The pixel mask is the size of the
output image.  There is one extra dimension with length equal to the number
of input images.  Each element of the highest dimension is a mask
corresponding to an input image with values of 1 for rejected or excluded
pixels and values of 0 for pixels which were used.  The order of the masks
is the order of the input images and image header keywords indexed by the
element identify the input images.  Note that the pixel positions are in
the output pixel coordinate system.
<P>
This mask is the only way to record whether a particular input image pixel
contributed to the output image.  As an example, consider the case of
three input two dimensional images of sizes 1020x1020, 1010x1010, and
1000x1000 with relative offsets of (0,0), (10,10), and (20,20).  The output
image would then be 1020x1020.
<P>
Suppose that the only input pixels not used are pixels (1,1) in each input
image.  Because of the offsets the first 10 rows and columns of the output
will be based on just a single pixel except for (1,1) which has no input
pixels.  The next 10 rows and colums of the output will be a combination
of 2 input pixels except (11,11) which is just based on pixel (11,11)
in the first input image.  Finally all other pixels except (21,21) will be
a combination of 3 values.
<P>
The rejection mask will be three dimensional of size 1020x1020x3.  Plane 1
will correspond to the first input image, plane 2 to the second, and so
on.  All of the pixels will be zero except for the following pixels
which will have a value of 1. In the first plane only pixel (1,1,1) will be
one.  In the second plane the first 10 rows and columns and pixel (11,11,2)
will be one.  And in the third plane, the first 20 rows and columns and pixel
(21,21,3) will be one.  So if we want to know about output pixel (11,11)
the rejection mask will tell us that pixels from the second and third
images were excluded.
<P>
This is a complex example because of the offsets and dissimilar sizes.
In the more common and simpler case of equal sizes and registered images,
the mask
planes would have one to indicate that the pixel in the input image at
that coordinate was not used.  For instance if pixel (12,15,2) is one
in the rejection mask then pixel (12,15) in the second input image was
excluded.
<P>
Note that one can use image sections to extract a mask matching the input
image.  For the example case with the offsets masks in the input
coordinates can be extracted with the commands
<P>
<PRE>
    cl&gt; imcopy rejmask[*,*,1] mask1
    cl&gt; imcopy rejmask[11:1020,11:1020,2] mask2
    cl&gt; imcopy rejmask[21:1020,21:1020,3] mask3

For the case of equal sized and registered images one could also use

<DD>The <I>nrejmasks</I> parameter produces optional pixel mask(s) giving the
number of input pixels rejected or excluded from the input images.  This is
equivalent to projecting the rejection mask described previously by summing
along the highest dimension.  Note that in this mask a value of 0 indicates
all the input pixels were used to create the output pixel and a value equal

significance.  The scaling values are given in the header under the

<P>
OFFSETS
<P>
The images to be combined need not be of the same size or overlap.  They
do have to have the same dimensionality which will also be the dimensionality
of the output image.  Any dimensional images supported by IRAF may be
used.
<P>
The overlap of the images is determined by a set of integer pixel offsets
with an offset for each dimension of each input image.  For example
offsets of 0, 10, and 20 in the first dimension of three images will
result in combining the three images with only the first image in the
first 10 colums, the first two images in the next 10 columns and
all three images starting in the 21st column.  At the 21st output column
the 21st column of the first image will be combined with the 11th column
of the second image and the 1st column of the third image.
<P>
The output image size is set by the maximum extent in each dimension
of any input image after applying the offsets.  In the above example if
all the images have 100 columns then the output image will have 120
columns corresponding to the 20 column offset in the third image.
Note that this same output image size is computed and used as the
basis for the <I>outlimits</I> parameter to specify a subregion to
actually be output.
<P>
The input image offsets are set using the <I>offset</I> parameter.  There
are four ways to specify the offsets.  If the word "<TT>none</TT>" or the empty
string "<TT></TT>" are used then all offsets will be zero and all pixels with the
same coordinates will be combined.  The output image size will be equal to
the biggest dimensions of the input images.
<P>
If "<TT>wcs</TT>" offsets are specified then the world coordinate systems (wcs)
in the image headers are used to derived the offsets.  The world coordinate
at the center of the first input image is evaluated.  Then integer pixel
offsets are determined for each image to bring the same world coordinate
to the same point.  Note the following caveats.  The world coordinate
systems must be of the same type, orientation, and scale and only the
nearest integer shift is used.
<P>
If the input images have offsets in a regular grid or one wants to make
an output image in which the input images are "<TT>mosaiced</TT>" together in
a grid then the special offset string  beginning with the word "<TT>grid</TT>"
is used.  The format is
<P>
<PRE>
	grid [n1] [s1] [n2] [s2] ...
</PRE>
<P>
where ni is the number of images in dimension i and si is the step in
dimension i.  For example "<TT>grid 5 100 5 100</TT>" specifies a 5x5 grid with
origins offset by 100 pixels.  Note that one must insure that the input
images are specified in the correct order.  This may best be accomplished
using a "<TT>@</TT>" list.  One useful application of the grid is to make a
nonoverlapping mosaic of a number of images for display purposes.  Suppose
there are 16 images which are 100x100.  The offset string "<TT>grid 4 101 4
101</TT>" will produce a mosaic with a one pixel border having the value set
by <I>blank</I> parameter between the images.
<P>
The offsets may be defined in a file by specifying the file name
in the <I>offset</I> parameter.  (Note that the special file name STDIN
may be used to type in the values terminated by the end-of-file
character).  The file consists of a line for each input image.  The lines
must be in the same order as the input images and so an "<TT>@</TT>" list may
be useful.  The lines consist of whitespace separated offsets one for
each dimension of the images.  In the first example cited above the
offset file might contain:
<P>
<PRE>
	0 0
	10 0
	20 0
</PRE>
<P>
where we assume the second dimension has zero offsets.
<P>
The offsets need not have zero for one of the images.  The offsets may
include negative values or refer to some arbitrary common point.
When the offsets are read by the program it will find the mininum
value in each dimension and subtract it from all the other offsets
in that dimension.  The above example could also be specified as:
<P>
<PRE>
	225 15
	235 15
	245 15
</PRE>
<P>
There may be cases where one doesn't want the mininum offsets reset
to zero.  If all the offsets are positive and the comment "<TT># Absolute</TT>"
appears in the offset file then the images will be combined with
blank values between the first output pixel and the first overlapping
input pixel.  Continuing with the above example, the file
<P>
<PRE>
	# Absolute
	10 10
	20 10
	30 10
</PRE>
<P>
will have the first pixel of the first image in the 11th pixel of the
output image.  Note that there is no way to "<TT>pad</TT>" the other side of
the output image.
<P>
OUTPUT OF SUBREGIONS
<P>
The output image size is computed from all of the input images including
the offsets as described previously.  The <I>outlimits</I> may be used to
specify a subregion of this full size to be created.  The syntax of this
parameter is pairs of whitespace separated numbers selecting the first and last
pixel in each output dimension.  The pairs for each dimension are also
whitespace separated and are given in order of the dimensions.  Any missing
values at the end of the string default to the full limits of the output
image.  If the requested limits fall outside the full output image they are
reset to the size of the full computed output size.
<P>
As an example, consider combining 10 images of size 1000x1000 with offsets
of 0, 1, ..., 9 along the first dimension.  Because of the offsets the full
output size is 1010x1000.  To output only the region [1:100,101:200]
of this full size the parameter value would be the string "<TT>1 100 101 200</TT>".
Note that if the value was just "<TT>1 100</TT>" then the output region would
be [1:100,1:1000].
<P>
The intended purpose for this option is to allow creating subregions using
a smaller number of images in the case of offset data taken at a raster of
positions.  This is important since when the number of images becomes too
large (&gt;4000) the program either has to prestack the images into a higher
dimensional single image (requiring equal sized images) or utilize an
inefficient algorithm where images are opened and closed for each input
line.  A detail of how this task works is that it is the number of images
required to be accessed for each output line that is significant.
<P>
The following example was developed when the maximum number of images
open at one time was ~240.  In V2.12 the number was increased to
more than 4000 so it is not as relevant though it may apply to very
large surveys with many small images.
<P>
As an example, consider a survey of a region of the sky composed of 8000
images which are each 500x1000.  The offsets between each image are 50
pixels along the first dimension and 900 pixels along the second dimension,
give or take a few pixels due to telescope pointing errors.  Thus this
survey consists of strips of exposures.  Within a strip the images over by
about 450 pixels.  Betweein strips the overlap is 100 pixels.  So the
strips consist 400 exposures and there are 20 strips.
<P>
The full size of this survey is then about 20450x18900.  At any point in a
single strip the number of images contributing is no more than 10.
Including the overlap of the strips the maximum number is then 20.  In
order to combine the data for such a survey one would like to create
subregion outputs which are 120 images from each strip.  The lines where
the two strips overlap then require 240 images.  To produce roughly equal
size regions we choose sizes along the first dimension of 5200 pixels.  The
number of lines in the output subregions might be the full size of the
survey.  However, it might be desirable to also  break the second dimension
into blocks for ease of display and manipulation.
<P>
The method for combining this example survey is then to combine the data in
four groups along the first dimension to produce subimages each 5200 pixels
wide which have no overlap.  The reason for wanting to create
nonoverlapping subregions is to simplify creation of the related masks,
most importantly, the exposure masks.  The <I>outlimits</I> parameter would
have the values "<TT>1 5200</TT>", "<TT>5201 10400</TT>", "<TT>10401 15600</TT>", and "<TT>15601 20800</TT>".
The second pair of limits is not specified to obtain the full size along
the second dimension.  Note that the last block will actually be smaller
than 5200 pixels since the survey is less than 20800 pixels.
<P>
In each combining step all the images must be specified for the input in
order to compute the full output size but then only those images needed to
produce an output line will be accessed at the same time.  By design this
is roughly 240 images for lines where the strips overlap.  The
nonoverlapping blocks can be mosaiced together with this task as a final
step if desired.
<P>
<P>
SCALES AND WEIGHTS
<P>
In order to combine images with rejection of pixels based on deviations
from some average or median they must be scaled to a common level.  There
are two types of scaling available, a multiplicative intensity scale and an
additive zero point shift.  The intensity scaling is defined by the
<I>scale</I> parameter and the zero point shift by the <I>zero</I>
parameter.  These parameters may take the values "<TT>none</TT>" for no scaling,
"<TT>mode</TT>", "<TT>median</TT>", or "<TT>mean</TT>" to scale by statistics of the image pixels,
"<TT>exposure</TT>" (for intensity scaling only) to scale by the exposure time
keyword in the image header, any other image header keyword specified by
the keyword name prefixed by the character <TT>'!'</TT>, and the name of a file
containing the scale factors for the input image prefixed by the
character <TT>'@'</TT>.
<P>
Examples of the possible parameter values are shown below where
"<TT>myval</TT>" is the name of an image header keyword and "<TT>scales.dat</TT>" is
a text file containing a list of scale factors.
<P>
<PRE>
	scale = none		No scaling
	zero = mean		Intensity offset by the mean
	scale = exposure	Scale by the exposure time
	zero = !myval		Intensity offset by an image keyword
	scale = @scales.dat	Scales specified in a file
</PRE>
<P>
The image statistics are computed by sampling a uniform grid of points with
the smallest grid step that yields less than 100000 pixels; sampling is used
to reduce the time needed to compute the statistics.  If one wants to
restrict the sampling to a region of the image the <I>statsec</I> parameter
is used.  This parameter has the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>
	[input|output|overlap] [image section]
</PRE>
<P>
The initial modifier defaults to "<TT>input</TT>" if absent.  The modifiers are useful
if the input images have offsets.  In that case "<TT>input</TT>" specifies
that the image section refers to each input image, "<TT>output</TT>" specifies
that the image section refers to the output image coordinates, and
"<TT>overlap</TT>" specifies the mutually overlapping region of the input images.
In the latter case an image section is ignored.
<P>
The statistics are as indicated by their names.  In particular, the
mode is a true mode using a bin size which is a fraction of the
range of the pixels and is not based on a relationship between the
mode, median, and mean.  Also masked pixels are excluded from the
computations as well as during the rejection and combining operations.
<P>
The "<TT>exposure</TT>" option in the intensity scaling uses the value of the
image header keyword specified by the <I>expname</I> keyword.  As implied
by the parameter name, this is typically the image exposure time since
intensity levels are linear with the exposure time in CCD detectors.
Note that the exposure keyword is also updated in the final image
as the weighted average of the input values.  Thus, if one wants to
use a nonexposure time keyword and keep the exposure time updating
feature the image header keyword syntax is available; i.e. !&lt;keyword&gt;.
<P>
Scaling values may be defined as a list of values in a text file.  The file
name is specified by the standard @file syntax.  The list consists of one
value per line.  The order of the list is assumed to be the same as the
order of the input images.  It is a fatal error if the list is incomplete
and a warning if the list appears longer than the number of input images.
Because the scale and zero levels are adjusted only the relative
values are important.
<P>
If both an intensity scaling and zero point shift are selected the
zero point is added first and the the scaling is done.  This is
important if the scale and offset values are specified by
header keywords or from a file of values.  However,
in the log output the zero values are given as the scale times
the offset hence those numbers would be interpreted as scaling
first and zero offset second.
<P>
The image statistics and scale factors are recorded in the log file
unless they are all equal, which is equivalent to no scaling.  The
scale factors are normalized so that the first input image has no
scaling.  This is done because the header of the first input image
is used as the template header for the combined output image.
By scaling to this first image this means that flux related keywords,
such as exposure time and airmass, are representative of the output
(except when the "<TT>sum</TT>" option is used).
<P>
Scaling affects not only the mean values between images but also the
relative pixel uncertainties.  For example scaling an image by a
factor of 0.5 will reduce the effective noise sigma of the image
at each pixel by the square root of 0.5.  Changes in the zero
point also changes the noise sigma if the image noise characteristics
are Poissonian.  In the various rejection algorithms based on
identifying a noise sigma and clipping large deviations relative to
the scaled median or mean, one may need to account for the scaling induced
changes in the image noise characteristics.
<P>
In those algorithms it is possible to eliminate the "<TT>sigma correction</TT>"
while still using scaling.  The reasons this might be desirable are 1) if
the scalings are similar the corrections in computing the mean or median
are important but the sigma corrections may not be important and 2) the
image statistics may not be Poissonian, either inherently or because the
images have been processed in some way that changes the statistics.  In the
first case because computing square roots and making corrections to every
pixel during the iterative rejection operation may be a significant
computational speed limit the parameter <I>sigscale</I> selects how
dissimilar the scalings must be to require the sigma corrections.  This
parameter is a fractional deviation which, since the scale factors are
normalized to unity, is the actual minimum deviation in the scale factors.
For the zero point shifts the shifts are normalized by the mean shift
before adjusting the shifts to a zero mean.  To always use sigma scaling
corrections the parameter is set to zero and to eliminate the correction in
all cases it is set to a very large number.
<P>
If the final combining operation is "<TT>average</TT>" then the images may be
weighted during the averaging.  The weights are specified in the same way
as the scale factors.  In addition the NCOMBINE keyword, if present, will
be used in the weights.  The weights, scaled to a unit sum, are printed in
the log output.
<P>
The weights are used for the final weighted average, sigma image, and
exposure mask output.  They are not used to form averages in the various
rejection algorithms.  For weights in the case of no scaling or only
multiplicative scaling the weights are used as given or determined so that
images with lower signal levels will have lower weights.  However, for
cases in which zero level scaling is used and the zero levels are
determined from image statistics (not from an input file or keyword) the
weights are computed from the initial weights (the exposure time, image
statistics, or input values) using the formula:
<P>
<PRE>
	weight_final = weight_initial / (scale * sky)
</PRE>
<P>
where the sky values are those from the image statistics before conversion
to zero level shifts and adjustment to zero mean over all images.  The
reasoning is that if the zero level is high the sky brightness is high and
so the S/N is lower and the weight should be lower.  If any sky value
determined from the image  statistics comes out to be negative a warning is
given and the none of the weight are adjusted for sky levels.
<P>
The weights are not adjusted when the zero offsets are input from a file
or keyword since these values do not imply the actual image sky value.
In this case if one wants to account for different sky statistics
in the weights the user must specify the weights in a file taking
explicit account of changes in the weights due to different sky
statistics.
<P>
When forming the final weighted averages if the sum of the weights of
the non-rejected or excluded pixels is zero then instead of producing
a zero average the unweighted average of the pixels is produced.  Similarly,
in the sigma calculation when the weights of the pixels are all zero
then the sigma is computed as if all pixels have unit weights.
<P>
When there are zero weights only the pixels with non-zero weights are
used in computing the output exposure time mask.  Note that the actual
weight values are not used but simply the sum of all exposure times
of pixels from images with non-zero weights is produced.
<P>
The purpose of using zero weights is to identify images that are of
poor quality (such as non-photometric or bad seeing) which are then
excluded in the final weighted average or exposure time.  However,
they contribute to the final image when there is no good
quality data but with an output exposure time of zero.
<P>
INPUT PIXEL MASKS
<P>
A pixel mask is a type of IRAF file having the extension "<TT>.pl</TT>" or
a FITS extension of "<TT>type=mask</TT>" which
identifies an integer value with each pixel of the images to which it is
applied.  In future masks may also be stored as special FITS extensions.
The integer values may denote regions, a weight, a good or bad
flag, or some other type of integer or integer bit flag.  In the common
case where many values are the same, this type of file is compact.
It is most compact and efficient if the majority of
the pixels have a zero mask value so frequently zero is the value for good
pixels.  Note that these files, while not stored as a strict pixel array,
may be treated as images in programs.  This means they may be created by
programs such as <B>mkpattern</B>, edited by <B>imedit</B>, examined by
<B>imexamine</B>, operated upon by <B>imarith</B>, graphed by <B>implot</B>,
and displayed by <B>display</B>.
<P>
To use pixel masks with <B>combine</B> one must associate a pixel
mask file with an image by entering the pixel list file name in the
image header under the keyword BPM (bad pixel mask) or some other
keyword to be specified.  This can be
done with <B>hedit</B>.  Note that the same pixel mask may be associated
with more than one image as might be the case if the mask represents
defects in the detector used to obtain the images.
<P>
If a pixel mask is associated with an image the mask is used when the
<I>masktype</I> parameter is set to a value other than "<TT>none</TT>" or "<TT></TT>".  Note that
when it is set to "<TT>none</TT>", mask information is not used even if it exists for
the image.  The values of <I>masktype</I> which apply masks are "<TT>goodvalue</TT>",
"<TT>badvalue</TT>", "<TT>goodbits</TT>", "<TT>badbits</TT>", and "<TT>!&lt;keyword&gt;</TT>".  The last choice
allows specifying the keyword whose value is the mask to be used otherwise
the keyword "<TT>BPM</TT>" is used.
<P>
The <I>masktype</I> choices are used in conjunction with
the <I>maskvalue</I> parameter.  When the mask type is "<TT>goodvalue</TT>" or
an explicit keyword is specified, the
pixels with mask values matching the specified value are included in
combining and all others are rejected.  For a mask type of
"<TT>badvalue</TT>" the pixels with mask values matching the specified value are
rejected and all others are accepted.  The bit types are useful for
selecting a combination of attributes in a mask consisting of bit flags.
The mask value is still an integer but is interpreted by bitwise comparison
with the values in the mask file.
<P>
If a mask operation is specified and an image has no mask image associated
with it (the BPM or specified keyword is absent), the mask values are taken
as all zeros.  In those cases be careful that zero is an accepted value
otherwise the entire image will be rejected.
<P>
When the number of input images exceeds the maximum number of open files
allowed by IRAF and the input images need to be "<TT>stacked</TT>" then the masks
are also stacked.  The stacking requires all the images to have the same size.
<P>
<P>
THRESHOLD REJECTION
<P>
In addition to rejecting masked pixels, pixels in the unscaled input
images which are below or above the thresholds given by the parameters
<I>lthreshold</I> and <I>hthreshold</I> are rejected.  Values of INDEF
mean that no threshold value is applied.  Threshold rejection may be used
to exclude very bad pixel values or as an alternative way of masking
images.  In the latter case one can use a task like <B>imedit</B>
or <B>imreplace</B> to set parts of the images to be excluded to some
very low or high magic value.
<P>
<P>
REJECTION ALGORITHMS
<P>
The <I>reject</I> parameter selects a type of rejection operation to
be applied to pixels not masked or thresholded.  If no rejection
operation is desired the value "<TT>none</TT>" is specified.
<P>
MINMAX
<P>
A specified fraction of the highest and lowest pixels are rejected.
The fraction is specified as the number of high and low pixels, the
<I>nhigh</I> and <I>nlow</I> parameters, when data from all the input images
are used.  If pixels have been rejected by offseting, masking, or
thresholding then a matching fraction of the remaining pixels, truncated
to an integer, are used.  Thus,
<P>
<PRE>
	nl = n * nlow/nimages + 0.001 
	nh = n * nhigh/nimages + 0.001 
</PRE>
<P>
where n is the number of pixels surviving offseting, masking, and
thresholding, nimages is the number of input images, nlow and nhigh
are task parameters and nl and nh are the final number of low and
high pixels rejected by the algorithm.  The factor of 0.001 is to
adjust for rounding of the ratio.
<P>
As an example with 10 input images and specifying one low and two high
pixels to be rejected the fractions to be rejected are nlow=0.1 and nhigh=0.2
and the number rejected as a function of n is:
<P>
<PRE>
	 n   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
	 nl  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
	 nh  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  2
</PRE>
<P>
CCDCLIP
<P>
If the images are obtained using a CCD with known read out noise, gain, and
sensitivity noise parameters and they have been processed to preserve the
relation between data values and photons or electrons then the noise
characteristics of the images are well defined.  In this model the sigma in
data values at a pixel with true value &lt;I&gt;, as approximated by the median
or average with the lowest and highest value excluded, is given by:
<P>
<PRE>
	sigma = ((rn / g) ** 2 + &lt;I&gt; / g + (s * &lt;I&gt;) ** 2) ** 1/2
</PRE>
<P>
where rn is the read out noise in electrons, g is the gain in
electrons per data value, s is a sensitivity noise given as a fraction,
and ** is the exponentiation operator.  Often the sensitivity noise,
due to uncertainties in the pixel sensitivities (for example from the
flat field), is not known in which case a value of zero can be used.
See the task <B>stsdas.wfpc.noisemodel</B> for a way to determine
these vaues (though that task expresses the read out noise in data
numbers and the sensitivity noise parameter as a percentage).
<P>
The read out noise is specified by the <I>rdnoise</I> parameter.  The value
may be a numeric value to be applied to all the input images or a image
header keyword containing the value for each image.  Similarly, the
parameter <I>gain</I> specifies the gain as either a value or image header
keyword and the parameter <I>snoise</I> specifies the sensitivity
noise parameter as either a value or image header keyword.
<P>
The algorithm operates on each output pixel independently.  It starts by
taking the median or unweighted average (excluding the minimum and maximum)
of the unrejected pixels provided there are at least two input pixels.  The
expected sigma is computed from the CCD noise parameters and pixels more
that <I>lsigma</I> times this sigma below or <I>hsigma</I> times this sigma
above the median or average are rejected.  The process is then iterated
until no further pixels are rejected.  If the average is used as the
estimator of the true value then after the first round of rejections the
highest and lowest values are no longer excluded.  Note that it is possible
to reject all pixels if the average is used and is sufficiently skewed by
bad pixels such as cosmic rays.
<P>
If there are different CCD noise parameters for the input images
(as might occur using the image header keyword specification) then
the sigmas are computed for each pixel from each image using the
same estimated true value.
<P>
If the images are scaled and shifted and the <I>sigscale</I> threshold
is exceeded then a sigma is computed for each pixel based on the
image scale parameters; i.e. the median or average is scaled to that of the
original image before computing the sigma and residuals.
<P>
After rejection the number of retained pixels is checked against the
<I>nkeep</I> parameter.  If there are fewer pixels retained than specified
by this parameter the pixels with the smallest residuals in absolute
value are added back.  If there is more than one pixel with the same
absolute residual (for example the two pixels about an average
or median of two will have the same residuals) they are all added
back even if this means more than <I>nkeep</I> pixels are retained.
Note that the <I>nkeep</I> parameter only applies to the pixels used
by the clipping rejection algorithm and does not apply to threshold
or bad pixel mask rejection.
<P>
This is the best clipping algorithm to use if the CCD noise parameters are
adequately known.  The parameters affecting this algorithm are <I>reject</I>
to select this algorithm, <I>mclip</I> to select the median or average for
the center of the clipping, <I>nkeep</I> to limit the number of pixels
rejected, the CCD noise parameters <I>rdnoise, gain</I> and <I>snoise</I>,
<I>lsigma</I> and <I>hsigma</I> to select the clipping thresholds,
and <I>sigscale</I> to set the threshold for making corrections to the sigma
calculation for different image scale factors.
<P>
CRREJECT
<P>
This algorithm is identical to "<TT>ccdclip</TT>" except that only pixels above
the average are rejected based on the <I>hsigma</I> parameter.  This
is appropriate for rejecting cosmic ray events and works even with
two images.
<P>
SIGCLIP
<P>
The sigma clipping algorithm computes at each output pixel the median or
average excluding the high and low values.  The sigma is then computed
about this estimate (without excluding the low and high values).  There
must be at least three input pixels, though for this method to work well
there should be at least 10 pixels.  Values deviating by more than the
specified sigma threshold factors are rejected.  These steps are repeated,
except that after the first time the average includes all values, until no
further pixels are rejected or there are fewer than three pixels.
<P>
After rejection the number of retained pixels is checked against the
<I>nkeep</I> parameter.  If there are fewer pixels retained than specified
by this parameter the pixels with the smallest residuals in absolute
value are added back.  If there is more than one pixel with the same
absolute residual (for example the two pixels about an average
or median of two will have the same residuals) they are all added
back even if this means more than <I>nkeep</I> pixels are retained.
Note that the <I>nkeep</I> parameter only applies to the pixels used
by the clipping rejection algorithm and does not apply to threshold
or bad pixel mask rejection.
<P>
The  parameters affecting this algorithm are <I>reject</I> to select
this algorithm, <I>mclip</I> to select the median or average for the
center of the clipping, <I>nkeep</I> to limit the number of pixels
rejected, <I>lsigma</I> and <I>hsigma</I> to select the
clipping thresholds, and <I>sigscale</I> to set the threshold for
making corrections to the sigma calculation for different image scale
factors.
<P>
AVSIGCLIP
<P>
The averaged sigma clipping algorithm assumes that the sigma about the
median or mean (average excluding the low and high values) is proportional
to the square root of the median or mean at each point.  This is
described by the equation:
<P>
<PRE>
	sigma(column,line) = sqrt (gain(line) * signal(column,line))
</PRE>
<P>
where the <I>estimated</I> signal is the mean or median (hopefully excluding
any bad pixels) and the gain is the <I>estimated</I> proportionality
constant having units of photons/data number.
<P>
This noise model is valid for images whose values are proportional to the
number of photons recorded.  In effect this algorithm estimates a
detector gain for each line with no read out noise component when
information about the detector noise parameters are not known or
available.  The gain proportionality factor is computed
independently for each output line by averaging the square of the residuals
(at points having three or more input values) scaled by the median or
mean.  In theory the proportionality should be the same for all rows but
because of the estimating process will vary somewhat.
<P>
Once the proportionality factor is determined, deviant pixels exceeding the
specified thresholds are rejected at each point by estimating the sigma
from the median or mean.  If any values are rejected the median or mean
(this time not excluding the extreme values) is recomputed and further
values rejected.  This is repeated until there are no further pixels
rejected or the number of remaining input values falls below three.  Note
that the proportionality factor is not recomputed after rejections.
<P>
If the images are scaled differently and the sigma scaling correction
threshold is exceeded then a correction is made in the sigma
calculations for these differences, again under the assumption that
the noise in an image scales as the square root of the mean intensity.
<P>
After rejection the number of retained pixels is checked against the
<I>nkeep</I> parameter.  If there are fewer pixels retained than specified
by this parameter the pixels with the smallest residuals in absolute
value are added back.  If there is more than one pixel with the same
absolute residual (for example the two pixels about an average
or median of two will have the same residuals) they are all added
back even if this means more than <I>nkeep</I> pixels are retained.
Note that the <I>nkeep</I> parameter only applies to the pixels used
by the clipping rejection algorithm and does not apply to threshold
or bad pixel mask rejection.
<P>
This algorithm works well for even a few input images.  It works better if
the median is used though this is slower than using the average.  Note that
if the images have a known read out noise and gain (the proportionality
factor above) then the "<TT>ccdclip</TT>" algorithm is superior.  The two algorithms
are related in that the average sigma proportionality factor is an estimate
of the gain.
<P>
The  parameters affecting this algorithm are <I>reject</I> to select
this algorithm, <I>mclip</I> to select the median or average for the
center of the clipping, <I>nkeep</I> to limit the number of pixels
rejected, <I>lsigma</I> and <I>hsigma</I> to select the
clipping thresholds, and <I>sigscale</I> to set the threshold for
making corrections to the sigma calculation for different image scale
factors.
<P>
PCLIP
<P>
The percentile clipping algorithm is similar to sigma clipping using the
median as the center of the distribution except that, instead of computing
the sigma of the pixels from the CCD noise parameters or from the data
values, the width of the distribution is characterized by the difference
between the median value and a specified "<TT>percentile</TT>" pixel value.  This
width is then multipled by the scale factors <I>lsigma</I> and <I>hsigma</I>
to define the clipping thresholds above and below the median.  The clipping
is not iterated.
<P>
The pixel values at each output point are ordered in magnitude and the
median is determined.  In the case of an even number of pixels the average
of the two middle values is used as the median value and the lower or upper
of the two is the median pixel when counting from the median pixel to
selecting the percentile pixel.  The parameter <I>pclip</I> selects the
percentile pixel as the number (if the absolute value is greater
than unity) or fraction of the pixels from the median in the ordered set.
The direction of the percentile pixel from the median is set by the sign of
the <I>pclip</I> parameter with a negative value signifying pixels with
values less than the median.  Fractional values are internally converted to
the appropriate number of pixels for the number of input images.  A minimum
of one pixel and a maximum corresponding to the extreme pixels from the
median are enforced.  The value used is reported in the log output.  Note
that the same percentile pixel is used even if pixels have been rejected by
offseting, masking, or thresholding; for example, if the 3nd pixel below
the median is specified then the 3rd pixel will be used whether there are
10 pixels or 5 pixels remaining after the preliminary steps.
<P>
After rejection the number of retained pixels is checked against the
<I>nkeep</I> parameter.  If there are fewer pixels retained than specified
by this parameter the pixels with the smallest residuals in absolute
value are added back.  If there is more than one pixel with the same
absolute residual (for example the two pixels about an average
or median of two will have the same residuals) they are all added
back even if this means more than <I>nkeep</I> pixels are retained.
Note that the <I>nkeep</I> parameter only applies to the pixels used
by the clipping rejection algorithm and does not apply to threshold
or bad pixel mask rejection.
<P>
Some examples help clarify the definition of the percentile pixel.  In the
examples assume 10 pixels.  The median is then the average of the
5th and 6th pixels.  A <I>pclip</I> value of 2 selects the 2nd pixel
above the median (6th) pixel which is the 8th pixel.  A <I>pclip</I>
value of -0.5 selects the point halfway between the median and the
lowest pixel.  In this case there are 4 pixels below the median,
half of that is 2 pixels which makes the percentile pixel the 3rd pixel.
<P>
The percentile clipping algorithm is most useful for clipping small
excursions, such as the wings of bright objects when combining
disregistered observations for a sky flat field, that are missed when using
the pixel values to compute a sigma.  It is not as powerful, however, as
using the CCD noise parameters (provided they are accurately known) to clip
about the median.
<P>
The  parameters affecting this algorithm are <I>reject</I> to select this
algorithm, <I>pclip</I> to select the percentile pixel, <I>nkeep</I> to limit
the number of pixels rejected, and <I>lsigma</I> and <I>hsigma</I> to select
the clipping thresholds.
<P>
GROW REJECTION
<P>
Neighbors of pixels rejected by the rejection algorithms
may also be rejected.  The number of neighbors to be rejected
is specified by the <I>grow</I> parameter which is a radius in pixels.
If too many pixels are rejected in one of the grown pixels positions
(as defined by the <I>nkeep</I> parameter) then the value of that pixel
without growing will be used.
<P>
COMBINING
<P>
After all the steps of offsetting the input images, masking pixels,
threshold rejection, scaling, and applying a rejection algorithms the
remaining pixels are combined and output.  The pixels may be combined
by computing the median or by computing a weighted average.
<P>
<P>
SIGMA OUTPUT
<P>
In addition to the combined image and optional sigma image may be
produced.  The sigma computed is the standard deviation, corrected for a
finite population by a factor of n/(n-1), of the unrejected input pixel
values about the output combined pixel values.

7.  The next example selects dome flats and groups them by filter
and a sequence number.  The sequence gap is zero since any increment
in the sequence number means a new sequence.  Note the difference with
example 5 where the exposure time was used to separate to sequences.

<P>
8.  Since sequence numbers already contain sequence information an alternative
to using the sequence expression is just to use the sequence number.  In
this example the sequence number is part of the grouping expression.
The filter in the grouping expression is redundant but provides a more
recognizable name.

10.  In the next two examples we consider MEF files.  The files have two
image extensions with extension names "<TT>im1</TT>" and "<TT>im2</TT>".  In both examples
the object exposures are selected and grouped by filter.  First the
extension parameter is set to null to combine all extensions to a single
output image.  In the second case the extensions are combined separately.
Note the use of the substring function to used the numeric part of the
extension name.
