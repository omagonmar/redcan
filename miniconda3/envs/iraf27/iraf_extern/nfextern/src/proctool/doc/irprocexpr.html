<P>
The <B>irproc</B> task uses of expressions which treat keywords and pixel
values as operands.  The expressions are used to select and group images,
provide sort keys, evaluate exposure times, apply a non-linearity
corrections and idenitfy bad pixels.  The expressions provide a great deal
of flexiblity and accomodate data from different instruments within and
between observatories.
<P>
The expression syntax follows common algebraic and programming rules.  For
instance it is the same as available in the CL.  The main things to
understand are what constitutes a operand, what type of final value is
required, and what functions are provided.
<P>
Expressions consist of operands, numeric and string constants, operators,
and functions.  Parentheses are also used to control the evaluation order
as in standard algebraic expression.  String constants are quoted strings
and numeric constants are pure unquoted numbers.  Numbers may be given in
sexagesimal notation and are automatically converted to decimal numbers.
The operators are arithmetic, logical, and string.
<P>
One feature of the <B>irproc</B> parameter values where the expressions are
specified is that the expression may be read from a file using the @file
syntax.  This is useful if expressions are long.  In the file newlines may
be used make the expression more readable.
<P>

<UL>
<P>
Except for the bad pixel and linearity correction expressions the only
operands are keyword names.  This means a operand is anything that is
allowed for a keyword name and which is not quoted in the expression.
There is one exception for keywords that include the characters that
correspond to the operators in expressions.  In this case the keyword is
quoted as a string and then referenced as a keyword using a leading @
character; e.g.  @"<TT>date-obs</TT>".
<P>
In the bad pixel and linearity expressions the values of pixels in the
image being processed.  The linearity expression also allows using the
values of pixels representing coefficients in a linearity coefficient image
as operands.  The pixels in the image being processed are referenced by the
operand $I.  The pixels in the coefficient image are reference by $C1, $C2,
etc.  The number refers to the element of the third dimension of the
coefficient image.
<P>
There are some special operands that relate to standard elements of
an image and may not be the same as the FITS keywords.  These are
<P>
<PRE>
	title - title of the exposure
	naxis - number of axes
	naxis1 - number of pixel along the first axis
	naxis2 - number of pixel along the second axis

The following operators are recognized in expressions.  With the exception
of the operators "<TT>?</TT>", "<TT>?=</TT>", and "<TT>@</TT>", the operator set is equivalent to that
available in the CL.
<P>
<PRE>
        +  -  *  /              arithmetic operators
        **                      exponentiation
        //                      string concatenation
        !  -                    boolean not, unary negation
        &lt;  &lt;= &gt;  &gt;=             order comparision (works for strings)
        == != &amp;&amp; ||             equals, not equals, and, or
        ?=                      string equals pattern
        ? :                     conditional expression (ternary operator)
        @                       reference a operand
</PRE>
<P>
The operators "<TT>==</TT>", "<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>", and "<TT>||</TT>" may be abbreviated as "<TT>=</TT>", "<TT>&amp;</TT>", and "<TT>|</TT>"
if desired.  The ?= operator performs pattern matching upon strings.
The pattern syntax is that described for the task <B>match</B>.
The @ operator is required to reference keywords with
one of the operator characters.  This is most likely to be used as:
<P>
<PRE>
        @"date-obs"
</PRE>
<P>
A point to be aware of is that in the ?: conditional expression both
possible result values are evaluated though the result of the expression
is only one of them.

A number of standard intrinsic functions are recognized within
expressions.  Many of these may not be useful in the context of the
<B>irproc</B> expressions but are part of the language.  The set of
functions currently supported is shown below.
<P>
<PRE>
	abs     atan2   deg     log     min     real    sqrt
	acos    bool    double  log10   mod     short   str
	asin    cos     exp     long    nint    sin     tan
	atan    cosh    int     max     rad     sinh    tanh
</PRE>
<P>
The trigonometric functions operate in units of radians.
The <I>min</I> and <I>max</I> functions may have any number of arguments up
to a maximum of sixteen or so (configurable).  The arguments need not all
be of the same datatype.
<P>
A function call may take either of the following forms:
<P>
<PRE>
        &lt;identifier&gt; <TT>'('</TT> arglist <TT>')'</TT>
        &lt;string_expr&gt; <TT>'('</TT> arglist <TT>')'</TT>
</PRE>
<P>
The first form is the conventional form found in all programming languages.
The second permits the generation of function names by string valued
expressions and might be useful on rare occasions.
<P>
There are a number of additional functions in addition to the above
intrinsic functions.  One may be particularly useful for <B>irproc</B>
to map arbitrary strings in keywords to the same value for grouping
or to translate long strings to shorter strings.  This is the
"<TT>strmap</TT>" function.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><A NAME="l_strmap">strmap (string, [oldstr, newstr, ...])</A></B></DT>
<! Sec='Functions' Level=0 Label='strmap' Line='strmap (string, [oldstr, newstr, ...])'>
<DD>The first argument is a reference string to be mapped.  Typically it
would be a keyword operand whose value is to be mapped, though it can be any
string valued expression including combinations of keyword values.  The
oldstr and newstr arguments must occur in pairs; i..e the number of
arguments must odd.  If the reference string value does not match any of
the oldstr arguments the value of the function is the reference string.
</DD>

<P>
The other special functions provide astronomical features.  These are:

1. The <I>intype</I> and <I>skytype</I> parameters are used to select
images from a list.  The expression is a boolean that is applied to
an image to determine whether it is to be used or not.  For input
images the most common type of selection is to select only one
observational type.  This is the same as the <I>dtype</I> and
<I>ftype</I> parameter and examples are found later.  But supposed
one wants to process only those images which have NGC123 in the
title:
<P>
<PRE>
	title?="NGC123"
</PRE>
<P>
To make the match case insensitive use the {} pattern matching
characters.
<P>
Now suppose one wants to process only the observations made in
the Ks filter where the filter string in the header is that
shown in the example:
<P>
<PRE>
	filter="Ks kp1234 K short filter"
</PRE>
<P>
One can combine the booleans to:
<P>
<PRE>
	title?="NGC123"&amp;filter="Ks kp1234 K short filter"
</PRE>
<P>
2.  Selection and identifications of observational types is a common
requirement.  Various observatories do this in diffent ways.  One
common way is with a string keyword such as OBSTYPE.  The following
matches when the image contains the keyword OBSTYPE with a value
that contains the word "<TT>flat</TT>" while ignoring the case.
<P>
<PRE>
	obstype?="{flat}"
</PRE>
<P>
But suppose the type is encoded as observation code and codes 3 and
4 indicated flat fields.
<P>
<PRE>
	expcode=3|expcode=4
</PRE>
<P>
Finally suppose the types are only identified by the user putting
the word flat in the title.  The same expression as for OBSTYPE could
be used with the keyword TITLE substituted.
<P>
3. The <I>imageid</I> and <I>filter</I> parameters are used to group
images.  Typically these would have the same value for all data that
fall into the group.  For instance if the keyword is AMPNUM to group
images by amplifier it might be as follows.
<P>
<PRE>
	ampnum
</PRE>
<P>
The filters are sometimes identified by filter wheel numbers but sometimes
they are identified by strings.  Now suppose it is possible that for
some reason the same filter may have different names; say because it
is manually entered by the observer.  Then one could use the STRMAP
function to map the strings to the same short value.
<P>
<PRE>
	strmap(filter,"H filter","H",
	    "Filter H","H",
	    "Filter 2","H",
	    "J filter","J",
	    "j","J",
	    "K short", "Ks"
	    "Kshort", "Ks)
</PRE>
<P>
For a long expression like this it might be put in an @file.  In this
expression the values, assuming there are no others, would be "<TT>H</TT>", "<TT>J</TT>", and
"<TT>Ks</TT>" and the images would be grouped by these values even though there are
several variants.
<P>
4. A bad pixel expression is used to identify bad pixels based on the
pixel values.  The most common type of expression is a threshold for
saturation.  Note that the bad pixel expression must evaluate to an
integer code where zero is a good pixel and any other positive integer
is a bad pixel.  A threshold saturation expression using a keyword
"<TT>saturate</TT>" would be
<P>
<PRE>
	$I &gt;= saturate ? 4 : 0
</PRE>
<P>
A more complex expression might convert a saturation value given in
electrons to data numbers based on the gain as in
<P>
<PRE>
	$I*gain &gt;= saturate ? 4 : 0
</PRE>
