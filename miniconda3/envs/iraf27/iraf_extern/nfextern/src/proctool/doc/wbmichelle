Subject: newfirm dhs estimates

Hi Frank,

As I said, it looks big...  Also, I didn't adjust the time estimates as
we just talked about (negotiating an ICD will take calendar time, but will
not be fulltime effort for that person for the entire duration of 
negotiations).  In addition, I changed categories as needed.

Michelle
