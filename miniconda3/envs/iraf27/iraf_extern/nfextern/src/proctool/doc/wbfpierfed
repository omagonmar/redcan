Hi Frank,

This is a first estimate on times for NEWFIRM. In all the cases where a  
written document is likely to be produced, I tried to take delays in  
having everybody to agree into consideration.

I am aware that the effort required is overestimated in some areas and  
underestimated in others. But I feel that the total time is  
approximately right.

What do you think?


Cheers
Francesco
