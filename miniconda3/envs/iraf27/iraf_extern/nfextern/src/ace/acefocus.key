				CURSOR COMMANDS

Some commands make use of the cursor position as well as the key entered.
All plots may not be available depending on the number of focus values and
the number of stars.

?	Page this help information
<space> Step through different focus or stars in current plot type
a	Spatial plot at a single focus (when there are matched points)
b	Spatial plot of best focus values (when there are matched points)
d	Delete star (when matched) or point (unmatched) nearest to cursor 
f	Size vs focus for all data
i	Information about point nearest the cursor
m	Size vs relative magnitude at one focus
q	Quit
r	Redraw
s	Toggle magnitude symbols in spatial plots
t	Size vs radius from field center at one focus
u	Undelete points
v	Undelete sigma clipped points
x	Delete nearest point, star, focus, or image (selected by query)
y	Delete points within box region (two cursor reads)


			COLON COMMANDS

A command without a value generally shows the current value of the
parameter while with a value it sets the value of the parameter.

:show <file>	Page all information for the current set of objects
:scale <val>	Pixel scale for size values
:xcenter <val>	X field center for radius from field center plots
:ycenter <val>	Y field center for radius from field center plots
