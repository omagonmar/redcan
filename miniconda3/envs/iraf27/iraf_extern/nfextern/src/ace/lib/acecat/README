	    ACECAT: Catalog Library for ACE and Related Packages

The purpose of the ACECAT library is to provided an interface to the
catalogs produced by the ACE package.

Currently the library is layered on the TABLES package.  To provided
customization a copy of the TABLES source is included in the tbtables
directory.  Other than modifying the mkpkg files and excluding the cfitsio
subdirectory the directory is direct copy.  Changes to routines in that
library are made in the parent directory.
