Sample files needed to GEOTRAN images in one color to that of another color are
included as follows:
  files for GEOTRAN the raw (S up E left) JH to K: n10[jh]tok.geo[co|db]
  files for GEOTRAN the raw (S up E left) HK to J: n10[hk]toj.geo[co|db]
  files for GEOTRAN the raw (S up E left) JK to H: n10[jk]toh.geo[co|db]
  files for GEOTRAN the oriented (N up E left) JH to K: n10[jh]toktr.geo[co|db]
  files for GEOTRAN the oriented (N up E left) HK to J: n10[hk]tojtr.geo[co|db]
  files for GEOTRAN the oriented (N up E left) JK to H: n10[jk]tohtr.geo[co|db]
etc.

Both (.geoco & .geodb) files are needed in the directory where images are
GEOTRANed.
