This package mem0 version C is revised from the second mem0 package version B
released in October 1992. 

There are still 5 tasks. The task foolfactor has been renamed to pfactor.
The suffix "b" to the task names to designate the version has been deleted.

The major revision is the use of the "model updating" technique in the
irme0 task. Some parameters in other tasks have been renamed.
