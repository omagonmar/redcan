NAME
iraf2bin -- Convert IRAF images into binary files
.ih
USAGE
iraf2bin images files
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
Input image list. Image sections are allowed.
.le
.ls files
Output file list. This list should be equal in length to the
list of input images.
.le
.ls data_type = "ubyte"
File data type. It can take the following values: \fBubyte\fR for unsigned
bytes, \fBushort\fR for unsigned short integers, \fBshort\fR for short
integers, \fBint\fR for integers, \fBlong\fR for long integers,
\fBreal\fR for reals, and \fBdouble\fR for double precission reals.
The actual number of bits used to represent of these numbers is machine
dependent, although normally a byte is eight bits long, a short is
sixteen bits long, an int and a long are thirty two bits long, 
a real is also thirty two bits long, and a double is sixty four bits long.
.le
.ls swap = "none"
Byte swap mode. It can take the following values: \fBnone\fR to leave data
untouched, \fBswap2\fR to swap every two bytes, and \fBswap4\fR to swap
every four bytes.
A byte in this case is always eight bits long.
With \fBswap2\fR the hexadecimal input sequence "0123456789ABCDEF" is
converted into "23016745AB89EFCD", and with \fBswap4\fR the same sequence
is converted into "67452301EFCDAB89"
The line length should be a multiple of two when swapping every two bytes,
and a multiple of four when swapping every four bytes.
.le
.ls header = no
Write Roddier header to the output file? This is a header of a length
(in bytes) is equal to four time the number of image columns. The number
of columns and the number of lines in the image are written as two integer
numbers in the first two locations of the header.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task takes a list of IRAF images and converts them into binary files.
An image section can be specified in the image names.
The output file data type is specified with the \fBdata_type\fR parameter,
regardless of the input image type. Truncation, loss of precission, or
integer overflow might occur if the output data type is not consistent
with the image data type.
The task can optionally swap bytes, every two or four bytes, before writing
out each image line to the file.
.sp
An optional header may be written to the output file. This header is
provided to generate files compatible with some programs written by
Claude Roddier, which are used at CTIO for optics analysis. The default
is not to write this header.

EXAMPLES
1.- Convert an image of any type into a short integer binary file,
with no byte swapping:
.nf

ct> iraf2bin image.imh file.bin data_type=short swap=none

.fi
2.- Convert two images containing short integer pixels, into two binary
files containing integers, swapping every two bytes:
.nf

ct> iraf2bin image1,image2 file1.bin,file2.bin data_type=int swap=swap2
.fi
