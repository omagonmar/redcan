    RV Cross Correlation
 
    c    	Select (cut) a region to be used in the correlation.  
    d    	Print the difference in pixels between two points on a spectrum.
    g    	Select the region of the correlation plot to be fit.
    l    	Page the current logfile of results if a logfile is being kept.
    p           Plot the data points as markers to the screen (corr. plot only).
    q    	Quit the task.
    r    	Replot the data.
    s    	Shift the object spectrum.  
    x    	Do the cross correlation.
    y           Same as 'g' but uses Y position to get endpoints.
    z           Zoom in on cursor X position.
    ?    	Print a help summary of keystrokes and commands.
 
The following colon commands may be used to set or show a named task parameter.
To show the current value of the parameter, just type it's name following a ':'.
