t_normalize.x
	Deleted declaration of 'factors' array and extra args to
	clpopni() call (9/29/03)

t_avgvel.x
	o  get_radii() call as function, changed to subroutine w/ correct
	    args.
	o  Added missing dmin/dmax args to get_radii() call
	o  Added missing rmin arg to lam_range() call 		(9/29/03, MJF)

t_mkcube.x
	Fixed a bug related with the way the cube image was created. The
	output image was opened as NEW_IMAGE, and the image header of the
	first image in the input list was moved into the output image, by
	copying one image structure into the other. This does not work
	under IRAF 2.10 anymore, so it was necessary to open the output
	image as a NEW_COPY of the first input image and to remove the
	explicit structure copy (PG 21/Apr/93).

fabry.cl
	Increased the size of "min_lenuserarea" to be four times the
	default value defined in IMIO, in order to have enough space
	for the output image header (PG 21/Apr/93).

fabry.hd
	Modified to allow HELP find the help pages of the package even 
	when the CTIO package is not loaded (PG 17/Aug/93).
