FABRY			29-Dic-87	(Pedro Gigoux)

This directory contains the files of the Fabry-Perot package, written
originally by George Jacoby on the VAX1. This package was ported into
the SUN with the following modifications:

1.- The "icur" program (Fortran) is no longer supported since is machine
dependent. The "jdisplay" program may be used instead.

2.- The "icntr" program was functionally changed from the user point of
view. It is no longer possible to mark stars with this program and the
"jdisplay" program may be used for this step. The algorithms were traslated
from Fortran to SPP and liked with the new main program, so the output
is totally compatible with the old one.

3.- The reference to the iraf$noao/onedspec/identify/libpkg.a libray was
eliminated, because it may cause problems with new versions. The file
"peaks.x" containig the referenced subroutines was copied to the package
directory. This change was made in the VAX as well.


The files that are modified from the VAX version are:

fabry.cl	package declaration
fabry.hd	package help declaration
fabry.men	package menu
fabry.par	package parameter file
mkpkg		mkpkg file


The files that are new from the VAX version are:

t_icntr.x	find star centroids
icntr.x		SPP version of some icntr.f subroutines
icntr.par	icntr parameter file


The files that are no longer present from the VAX version are:

icur.f		mark star positions
icntr.f		find star centroids
