mctable.gx
	Added mct_seqget() and mct_rew() procedures. The former was
	renamed mct_sget() to avoid a name collision with mct_seqput().
	In order to be consistent with naming conventions, mct_seqput()
	was renamed to mct_sput(). The table structure was also modified
	in order to handle counters for mct_sget(), and all procedures
	were modified acordingly (PG 21/Jan/91).

mctable.gx
	Splitted the file, one file per procedure. This was done in order
	to solve a problem with the Fortran compiler that couldn't handle
	large files. The documentation of the package was stored in a
	separate file as well (mctable.hlp) (PG 21/Jan/91).

mctget.gx
mcrew.x
mctsget.gx
mctsput.gx
	Fixed minor bugs in sequential procedures due to the modification
	of the table structure (PG 20/Feb/91).

mctsave.gx
	Added better comment fields to the output file generated by
	the mct_save() procedure (PG 21/Feb/91).

zzdebug.gx
	Modified to make use of the new procedures, and also reorganized
	(code divided in more procedures) because the SPP string space
	was overflowing (PG 06/Mar/91).

mctable.hlp
	Updated documentation (PG 07/Mar/91).

mctput.gx
	Changed TY_REAL in realloc() to TY_PIXEL. This bug was reported by
	Lindsey Davis (PG 31/May/91).
