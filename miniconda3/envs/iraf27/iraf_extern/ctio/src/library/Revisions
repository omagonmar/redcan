directory.x
	Changed procedure names to be more consistent with IRAF 
	conventions (PG 17/jan/90).

directory.x
	Changed string allocation in order to guarantee that string
	overflow won't ocurr again. A new field to keep track of the
	current root directory string space was added to the directory
	structure (PG 17/jan/90).

julian.x
	Changed dble() to double() (PG 27/Aug/90).

fft1d.x
	Added missing mfree() call to free the FFT structure, fixed one
	of the calls to aclxx() to clear the input buffer, added fft1_dump()
	procedure to dump the FFT structure, added magic number to the FFT
	structure, added fft1_chk() procedure to check for null FFT pointer
	and bad magic number, and added calls to the latter to all the high
	level entry points (uf!) (PG 15/Nov/90).

fft1d.x
	Changed fft1_get() procedure to return all the points in the
	output buffer, instead of the first half (PG 16/Nov/90).

fft1d.x
	Added "flip" parameter to fft1_init() in order to select how to
	retrieve the FFT values with fft1_get() (PG 16/Nov/90).

sort.x
	Added check to srt_sort() in order to call the quick-sort routine
	only if there are at least two data points (PG 14/Oct/91).

format.x
	Changed the "count" parameter being passed to the user supplied
	function to a pointer to a user supplied pointer. In this way it
	will be possible to pass any number of quantities, of any type,
	to the user supplied procedure (PG 20/Apr/92).

fft1d.x
	Added fft1_clear() routine to let the caller clear the FFT
	buffers and reset th counter without freeing them. This reduces
	the overhead when the FFT will be used multiple times, such as
	in image lines (PG 15/Dec/92).
