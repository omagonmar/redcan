SPHOT			08-Jun-88 		(Pedro Gigoux)

This directory contains the sources of the star photometry programs. Since
this program was ported from FORTRAN to SPP, some of the original subroutines
are still in FORTRAN. Only the I/O and CL interaction was rewritten.

The files contained here are:

mkpkg			mkpkg file

photom.f		mountain photometry subroutine

radius2.f		subroutine to compute the square of the distance
			beteen two points

sphot.com		sphot common

t_sphot.x		task procedures

value.f			subroutine to compute pixel intensity

xysetup.f		boundary setup subroutine
