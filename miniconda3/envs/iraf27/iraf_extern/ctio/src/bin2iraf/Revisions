bin2iraf.par
t_bin2iraf.x
	Added "nskip" parameter to specify the number of bytes to skip
	at the beggining of the file. This was done to allow the user
	skip a header that might be in the file (PG 28/May/92).

bin2iraf.par
t_bin2iraf.x
	Added support for real images and cleaned the code a little
	bit in the part that deals with non-floating point images. The
	parameter file was modified to add the real type (PG 28/May/92).

t_bin2iraf.x
	Fixed a problem when byte swapping was used. It turns out that
	the number of pixels in a line was used when swapping a line
	instead of the number of bytes, as expected by the bswap2()
	and bswap4() routines. This gave some garbage at the end of
	each output image line (PG 19/Mar/93).
