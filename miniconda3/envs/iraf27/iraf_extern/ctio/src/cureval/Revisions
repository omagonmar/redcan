cureval.gx
	Modified cev_curfout() in order to be compatible with the new
	output format of CURFIT introduced with IRAF 2.10. Also, fixed
	a bug related with the number of coefficients when the function
	was an spline1 or spline3. It turned out that the program was
	using the function order supplied by CURFIT as the number of
	coefficients instead of adding one (+1) for the spline1 and
	adding three (+3) for the spline3 (PG 28/Dec/92).
