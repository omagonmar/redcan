t_magband.x
	Added flux switch to output either the flux (yes) or the magnitude
	(no). The parameter file was updated as well. Also minor changes in
	the output format were made in order to fit flux numbers and add
	comment character is title lines (PG 17/Jan/90).

t_magband.x
	Added check for zero flux when computing the magitude, since
	it has to compute the logarithm of it. It will return an INDEF
	value in this case (PG 08/Jun/90).

t_magband.x
	Splitted output format for magnitudes and fluxes, in order to get
	a fixed format for magnitudes and a variable (g) format for fluxes
	(PG 16/Oct/90).

mkpkg
t_magband.x
	Fixed a bug with the determination of the starting and ending pixel
	positions for the integration limits. The problem was that the pixel
	positions were computed taking into account the "center of the pixel"
	correction. This was fine when the mode was MODE_STANDARD, but it was
	wrong when the image interpolation library was being used, since the
	latter makes this correction internaly. Other minor fixes were done
	as well, like not including imhdr.h anymore, allocating the right
	size for the structure (it was being allocated too big), and removing
	lines that were commented out (PG 19/Jul/91).

t_magavg.x
	Moved this file to this directory in order to keep the code of
	MAGBAND and MAGAVG together (PG 14/Oct/91).

t_magavg.x
	Added extra column in the output to print the error, computed as
	the sigma divided by the number of effective points, i.e. without
	the rejected points (PG 14/Oct/91).

magavg.com
t_magavg.x
	The code was completely revised in order to allow for spectra with
	different lenghts. In the previous version all bandpasses had to
	be same for all spectra, thus rejecting spectra shorter or longer
	than the first spectrum in the input list. A common block was added
	since the sort procedures need to pass the table pointer to a user
	defined comparison procedure (PG 17/Oct/91).

t_magavg.x
	Increased maximum number of spectra (MAX_SPECTRA), and specially the
	maximum number of bands (MAX_BANDS). The number of bands was too small
	and the task was crashing with large data sets. The problem arises
	because the tables used to sort bandpasses don't reallocate memory as
	needed, as opposed to the spectrum table (PG 09/Dec/91).

magband.par
t_magband.x
	Added "convert" parameter to disable the conversion of wavelengths
	from meters to Angstroms (PG 19/May/92).

t_magband.x
	Defined independent output formats for the wide and long outputs,
	and modified the code acordingly. This change was done to allow
	for decimal places in the wavelength and width (PG 20/May/92).
