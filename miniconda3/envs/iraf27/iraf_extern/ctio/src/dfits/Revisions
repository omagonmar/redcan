fits_rpixels.x
	Updated from dataio$fits/fits_rpixels.x since that file changed
	in the 2.8 release (PG 17/jan/90).

t_dfits.x
	Added call to mtfile() to determine if the FITS file was a tape
	drive name. In this way the node name is being used now, thus
	allowing the task to use networking (PG 17/jan/90).

dfits.par
format -> format.dat
	Renamed default format file and changed reference to it in the
	parameter file acordingly (PG 07/jan/91).
