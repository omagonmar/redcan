This directory contains the apropos databases used by the apropos task.
These files are just text files with one line per reference found in the
help menus. Each line contains the reference name (task, package, etc),
followed by its description, and by the package path that contains it.
The package name is enclosed in parenthesis. There is one file per external
package plus one for the standard IRAF system (root.db).
