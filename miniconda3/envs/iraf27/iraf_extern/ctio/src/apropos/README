APROPOS			28-Oct-88		(Pedro Gigoux)

This directory contains the files of the apropos and mkapropos tasks. The
first on is like the UNIX apropos, but for any task that's mentioned in
a menu file inside IRAF. The second task is for building the apropos database
text file, and it's similar to the mkhelpdb task. This task was upgraded to
work with IRAF 2.8. The files are:

help.h		help files copied from system$help/ wihout modification
helpdir.h
helpdir.x

mkpkg		mkpkg file

t_apropos.x	main apropos procedure

t_mkapropos.x	main mkapropos procedure
