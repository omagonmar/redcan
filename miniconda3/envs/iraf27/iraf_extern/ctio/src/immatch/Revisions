	The key help file was moved to the lib$scr/ directory, and the
	pathname definition was changed acordingly (PG 09/Apr/90).


t_immatch.x
	Removed call to xt_mkimsec, because it crashed if the image
	section was a null string (PG 17/Apr/91).
	
immatch.par
t_immatch.x
	Added parameter "imshift" to decide whether the output is a CL
	script that runs the IMSHIFT task automaticaly, or if it's just
	a list of image names and shifts (PG 19/Apr/91).

t_immatch.x
	Added names of the input and reference images to the graph title,
	in order to know which image is being processed when the input
	is an image list (PG 19/Apr/91).

immatch.par
t_immatch.x
	Added "xmax" and "ymax" parameters to set the maximum shift in the

	Increased the default value of the "width" parameter from three to
	five pixels, since it works better with that value. The help page
