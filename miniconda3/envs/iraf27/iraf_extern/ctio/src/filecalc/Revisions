fceval.gx
	Adding a missing 'nhist' dummy arg to fc_vmode$t call (9/29/03, MJF)

fcfiles.x
	Added a missing argument to the fc_finit() call (9/29/03, MJF)

fcproc.x
	Changed call to fmt_fprintf() to fmt_printf() since the output
	was to the standard output, and called the latter as a function
	and not as a procedure as it was done before (PG 08/May/92).

fcfiles.x
fcgetline.x
fcproc.x
fcreadexp.x
filecalc.h
t_filecalc.x
	Added the "lines" parameter to select line ranges in the input
	files. It was necessary to add the parameter in the calling
	sequence of fc_proc() and fc_fgetlines(). It was also necessary
	to split fc_getline() in two flavors; one with line ranges
	(fc_rgetline) and another without line ranges (fc_getline), and
	to create a new common function dealing with comments and blank
	lines (fc_trimline). This splitting was necessary because the
	fc_getline() function was used to read lines from input files,
	and to read lines from the file containing an expression. A bug
	in the calling sequenec of fc_getline() in fc_readexp() was
	detected and fixed (PG 25/Jun/92).
