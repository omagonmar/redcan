t_eqwidth.x
	Changed procedure decl for eqw_proc() from real function to
	subroutine since there was no return value  (9/29/03, MJF)

t_eqwidth.x
	Changed the radial velocity factor evaluation. The signs were
	reversed in the square root (PG 8/Feb/90).

t_eqwidth.x -> t_eqwidths.x
	Changed name of this file to t_eqwidths.x. The name of the task
	was changed acordingly (PG 06/Mar/90).

t_eqwidths.x
	Fixed the way the radial velocity factor was being computed. The
	square root argument was giving negative values because the speed
	of light was being substracted from the radial velocity of the
	object instead of substracting the radial velocity of the object
	from the speed of light (PG 08/Aug/90).

t_eqwidths.x
	Changed the speed of light from meters/second to kilometers/second.
	Radial velocities supplied by the user should now be expressed in
	kilometers/second (PG 08/Aug/90).

t_eqwidths.x
	Fixed a problem in the way the flux of a line was computed. It now
	substracts the spectrum from the continuum and then computes the
	flux, preserving the flux sign. This will give a positive width for
	emission lines and a negative width for absorption lines. Also, 
	an unknown problem that showed up when a null radial velocity file
	name was given, was fixed (PG 27/Oct/93).
