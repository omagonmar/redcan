t_imtest.x
	Added verify switch when generating delete and imdelete calls.
	The parameter file was updated as well. Also some procedures were
	renamed for consistency (PG 17/jan/90).

t_imtest.x
	Changed calls to recursive directory procedures to match the
	changes made on them (PG 17/jan/90).

t_imtest.x
	Added verbose and ignore switches. The parameter and help file were
	updated as well (PG 03/mar/90).


t_imtest.x
	Renamed procedures from imt_* to imts_*, in order to be consistent
	with naming conventions, and to avoid name conflicts with the
	Image Templete Package (PG 27/Apr/92).

t_imtest.x
	Added a call to imunmap() in imts_headers() in order to close
	every image before processing the next one in the list. This bug
	was probably causing a "Memory overflow" error (PG 13/Oct/92)
