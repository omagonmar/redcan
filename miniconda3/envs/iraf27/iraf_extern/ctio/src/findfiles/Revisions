t_findfile.x
	Changed calls to recusive directory procedures to match the
	change made on them (PG 17/jan/89).

t_findfile.x
	Changed string matching to full pattern matching (such as in
	directory) to use a more natural way of using file name
	templates. Help page changed as well. (PG 09/feb/90).

t_findfile.x
	Renamed this file to t_findfiles.x and changed the task name
	acordingly (PG 06/mar/90).

t_findfile.x
	Fixed problem of assigment of an integer expression to a boolean
	variable. This problem went undetected on sparc and 68881 machines,
	and was detected only in the fpa machines, probably because they
	have the old Fortran compiler (PG 20/apr/90).
