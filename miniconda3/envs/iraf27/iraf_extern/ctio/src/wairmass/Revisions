t_wairmass.x
wairmass.par
	Added epoch parameter. This upgrade was installed, but not working
	yet. Anyway, the parameter must be there in order to avoid crashing
	the task (PG 23/apr/90).

t_wairmass.x
	Added wrm_gethdr() procedure to get the hour angle, right ascension,
	and siderial time from the image header. The new procedure performs
	consistency checks to avoid null values in the image header in order
	to come up with good values (PG 23/Mar/92).

t_wairmass.x
wairmass.par
	Removed parameter "epoch" from the parameter file until the
	precession for epoch is really implemented. The code was
	modified accordingly (PG 23/Mar/92)
