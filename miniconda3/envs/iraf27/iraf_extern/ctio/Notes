# CTIO external package

# The following changes were made to the initial export tape for CTIO
# to configure it as an layered package.  There were not changes to
# source code or basic directory organization. (Valdes, Dec. 14, 1989)

CTIO.cl -> ctio.cl
CTIO.hd -> ctio.cl
CTIO.mkpkg -> mkpkg
CTIO.x -> x_ctio.x
ctio.par +
ctio.men +
lib +
lib/* +
bin +
bin.generic +
bin.f68881 +
bin.ffpa +
bin.sparc +
lib/mkfloat.csh +
    1. Renamed CTIO.* files to indicated files.
    2. Made new ctio.men which only refers to tasks/packages available
    3. Commented out reference to dst in ctio.cl and mkpkg since this
       software depends on a nonexported library.
    4. Added ctio.par file for keeping version.
    5. Created lib and bin directories.
    6. Put the standard lib stuff in lib directory
    7. Changed all logical directory references from local to ctio.
    8. Changed local$src/ directories to ctio.
    9. Removed comments about merging into local package.
    10. Add strip and multiple architecture stuff into mkpkg file.
    11. Made copy of hlib$mkfloat.csh with fix to allow the parent
	directory to have libraries and objects without deleting the
	executables in the bin directories.

# Under the directive of Doug Tody the following further changes were needed.

    1. Created a new subdirectory and moved the source subdirectories there.
    2. Took out architecture stuff and subpackage stuff from mkpkg.

mkpkg +
    1. Modified to call updates of subdirectories and use standard
       architecture stuff.
    2. Includes commented out DST directory.

lib/mkfloat.csh -
    Removed bug fixed version of this file.

# The CTIO local package was merged into the ctio export package in
# order to have single version of the package to mantain. Both CTIO
# specific software, and exportable software were included, but
# references to site specific software are removed when a tape is
# made to outside sites (Pedro Gigoux, 12 April, 1990).

# The CTIO package was reorganized to simplify maintenance and distribution.
# Two new packages were added: CTLOCAL and CTOBSOLETE. The first one
# will contain all the site specific software and the second one all the
# sotware that has be obsoleted by other tasks in the standard IRAF.

===================================================================== 
 CTIO package update to aix4. Feb 26 , 1998 (Nelson Zarate)

fabry/rgnfit.f/rngft0()
   "rngfit.f", line 100.24: 1516-023 (E) Subscript is out of bounds.
   "rngfit.f", line 101.27: 1516-023 (E) Subscript is out of bounds.
   "rngfit.f", line 101.51: 1516-023 (E) Subscript is out of bounds.
	
	Change (1) for (*) for the routine arguments
/src/bitstat/bitstat.f
   "bitstat.f", line 15.31: 1513-041 (W) Arguments of the wrong type were 
    specified for the INTRINSIC procedure "mod".

	mod(sval,2) change to mod(int(sval),2).

src/fitrad/ftrfit(r,d)
    "ftrfitd.f", line 164.12: 1513-029 (W) The number of arguments to 
    "icgfid" difers from the number of arguments in a previous reference. 

	It appears that the non_interactive call needs to be to the
	routine 'ic_fitr' rather that icg_fitr, just by looking at the
	number of arguments. Changed.

src/gki2cad/t_gki2cad.x

	Changed "call cad_comment ("GKI_ESCAPE (NEQ)")"
	to
	"call cad_comment (cd, "GKI_ESCAPE (NEQ)")"


src/helio/helio.f

"helio.f", line 86.65: 1515-020 (S) Syntax Error: Token " ) " is missing. 
"helio.f", line 119.67: 1515-020 (S) Syntax Error: Token " ) " is missing.

	Lines too long. Edited the file to broke them into 2 lines.

src/iraf2bin/iraf2bin.f

	Several 'call error' have only the string argument. Change to add
	'0' as 1st argument.

src/iraf2bin/t_iraf2bin.f

	Same 'printf' calls have an extra '0,' as 1st argument. Removed.
src/sphot/t_sphot.x

	Change 
	define  ERR_LAST       ERR_SKY
	to
	define  ERR_LAST       ERR_NOISE
