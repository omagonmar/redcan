growthcurve.cl
	Fixed a problem with the fit file. The task was not checking
	for the file existence before renaming the temporary file,
	thus crashing the task (PG 04/Dic/90).

growthcurve.cl
	Fixed a problem with the magnitude correction. The task was
	adding one more difference than needed at the upper limit. This
	was giving greater magnitudes than expected (PG 04/Dic/90).

growthcurve.cl
	Added calls to take the integral part of aperture numbers when
	they are read from the output of CURFIT as real numbers. This
	prevents an error in the comparison against aperture numbers
	entered as integer numbers (PG 04/Dic/90).

growthcurve.cl
	Changed calls to APSELECT to TXDUMP, in order to reflect the
	new names used in IRAF 2.10 (PG 08/Sep/92).
