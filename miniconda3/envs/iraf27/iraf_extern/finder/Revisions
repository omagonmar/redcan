tastrom.cl
    - Added user queries in the case that ASTROM input/output files exist
    from a previous run.  Added parameter "silent" to allow user to turn
    off most of these by default.
    - Tastrom now includes the function of redo.cl to perform a new fit
    after manually editing the ASTROM input file.
    - Removed confusing "table empty" message in the case that no object
    coordinates are specified.
    - Removed dependency on sed to format ASTROM input file.  The astrom.x
    executable is now called directly and the "astrom" foreign task has
    been removed.  With these two changes, sites can install their own
    version of ASTROM as long as the user has the binaries on her path.
    No SunOS specific dependency remains.
    - Task only requires one input parameter now, defaulting the ASTROM
    input/output rootname to the table name.
    - RA/Dec tangent coordinate parameters are now real instead of
    string.  No special formatting is required for sexigesimal numbers.
    - Renamed epoch parameters as corresponding equinox names.  These
    are now strings, permitting Besselian ("B") or Julian ("J") prefixes
    to specify FK4 or FK5 values, respectively.
    - Added "geometry" parameter that is passed through as the ASTROM
    telescope type.  Allowed values are ASTR, SCHM, and some values for
    specific telescopes.  (Seaman, 1997-05-07)

t_tpeak.x
    Removed requirement for index column in object files, only the X and
    Y coordinates are now required.  If the index ID is omitted, the ID
    will be equivalent to the current row number in the table.
    (Seaman, 1997-06-18)

tpltsol.cl
    Removed "reopen database" query - all database activity is now
    appended to the file.  (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

tfinder.cl, dssfinder.cl
    Changed default reselect value to yes.  Changed prompt to be more
    obvious.  (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

tastrom.cl, tfinder.cl, dssfinder.cl
    Inverted various prompts from "reopen" to "overwrite".
    (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

t_tpeak.x
    Added ":selectpars" command as an alias for ":eparam selectpars".
    Removed requirement to double AND single quote string values in
    selectpars.  Table column names as entered by the user are now
    checked for validity.  Malformed selection criteria are omitted.
    The final selection expression is printed on the terminal.
    (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

selectpars.par
    Reworded prompts to remove no longer necessary string quoting advice.
    Note that old format still works for backwards compatibility.
    (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

package zzsetenv.def
    Added environment variables, gscnorth and gscsouth, to provide
    default values for the gscfind task pointers to the GSC CD-ROMS.
    This will make it more straightforward to configure the package
    outside of the Tucson headquarters (e.g., on Kitt Peak).
    (Seaman, 1997-08-04)

t_tpeak.x
    Deleted program objects are now removed permanently via the "d"
    keystroke.  The "cjklp" keystrokes now check explicitly whether
    the cursor is positioned closest to a catalog source or a program
    object.  (Seaman, 1997-08-05)

dssfinder.cl
    The EPOCH will now be used to generate a DATE-OBS if the DATE-OBS
    is missing.  This is intended to support the Quick V (?) format.
    Not obvious if this is the only difference between the two formats.
    Tfinder does not do this, since the EPOCH really means EQUINOX to
    the FITS standard.  (Seaman, 1997-08-05)

tpltsol.cl
    The task previously only checked for empty table input before
    entering the ccmap fitting routine.  Now tables with fewer than
    three centered catalog sources will generate an error message
    due to insufficient degrees of freedom.  Tables with three and
    four sources will generate warning messages.  There remains no
    protection against users who manually select a higher order fit
    than the data will support.  Users will ideally center at least
    five objects before entering the "e" keystroke (for instance).
    (Seaman, 1997-08-05)

t_tpeak.x, tastrom.cl
    Fixed a few more places where the coordinates were formatted real,
    not double.  These were likely not of numeric significance.
    (Seaman, 1997-08-05)

finder$lib/tbset.h (removed)
    This local copy was unnecessary and broke when Phil Hodge changed
    some buffer sizes.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-02)

t_tfield.x
    Added an access test on the output file.  Rearranged the tf_open
    routine to make it a bit more robust.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-02)

tfinder.cl, dssfinder.cl
    Replaced references to trename with rename.  A printf was missing
    the argument required by its format string.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-02)

t_tpeak.x
    Removed some debug statements.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-02)

tastrom.cl
    Inger Jorgenson supplied a fix for tastrom under the v2.1 tprint behavior.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-02)

tfinder.cl, dssfinder.cl, t_tfield.x, tfield.par
    Tweaked the Y2K fixes.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-03)

VERSION, finder.par
    updated version to v2.1
    (Seaman, 2000-02-03)

doc$tfinder.hlp, doc$tfield.hlp
    Corrected some out of date references to EPOCH (now EQUINOX) and
    DATE-OBS.
    (Seaman, 2000-02-03)

t_tfield.x
    Fixed a problem predicting coordinate locations for transposed
    image options - especially for non-square transposed images.
    (R. Seaman, 2000-02-10)

t_tfield.x
    Commented out some now superfluous variable declarations.
    (R. Seaman, 2000-02-11)

VERSION, finder.par
    updated version to v2.2
    (Seaman, 2000-02-11)
