procedure addring(mask)

# Slight change of display levels 2/28/93 MD
# Script addring.cl adds a ring around all objects in a mask image.
# 11 July 1992 by John S. Ward
# Mod. 19 May 1993 by Mark Dickinson to make it compatable 
#  with .pl masks, to add mask as query parameter, to make number
#  of added rings a variable, and to eliminate autodisplay.
#
# NOTE:  This routine assumes that "objects" are masked with 1s
# while blank sky is represented by 0s.
