PARAMETERS
.ls inlist
The list of input sky subtracted images. The input image list must be in order
with each image offset from the previous one by approximately \fIxlag\fR
pixels in x and \fIylag\fR pixels in y.
.le
.ls output
The output total offsets file suitable for input to the xnregistar task.
Output contains the input image name, the total x offset, the total y offset,
and the default exposure time in columns 1 through 4 respectively. The total
x and y offsets of image N are defined as the shifts x(N) - x(1) and
y(N) - y(1) required to place image N in the same coordinate system as image 1.
The default exposure time is 1 time unit.
.le
.ls shifts = ""
The optional relative offsets file. Shifts contains the input image name,
the relative x offset and the relative y offset in columns 1 through 3
respectively. The relative offsets of image N are defined as the shifts
x(N-1) - x(N) and y(N-1) - y(N) required to register image N to image N-1.
.le
.ls hwhmpsf = 1.25
The approximate half-width at half-maximum of the image PSF in pixels. If the
PSF width varies significantly over the sequence hwhmpsf should be set to the
average value for the sequence.
.le
.ls threshold = 50.0
The object detection threshold above local background in ADU. Threshold should
be set no lower than 4 * sigma where sigma is the standard deviation of the
background pixels in ADU.
.le
.ls xlag = 0.0, ylag = 0.0
The approximate relative offsets x(N) - x(N-1) and y(N) - y(N-1) between
adjacent images in the input image list.
.le
.ls cbox = 7.0
The centering box size in pixels.
.le
.ls fradius = 2.5 (hwhmpsf)
The fitting radius in units of hwhmpsf. Fradius defines the size of the
Gaussian kernel used to compute the density enhancement image and the size
of the image region used to do the moment analysis in the object detection
step.
.le
.ls sepmin = 5.0 (hwhmpsf)
The minimum separation for detected objects in units of hwhmpsf.
.le
.ls datamin = INDEF, datamax = INDEF
The minimum and maximum good data values in ADU. Datamin and datamax
default to the constants -MAX_REAL and MAX_REAL respectively.
.le
.ls roundlo = 0.0, roundhi = 0.5
The minimum and maximum ellipticity values for detected objects, where
ellipticity is defined as 1 - b / a, and a and b are the semi-major and
semi-minor object axis lengths respectively.
.le
.ls sharplo = 0.5, sharphi = 2.0
The minimum and maximum sharpness values of the detected objects, where
sharpness is defined to be the ratio of the object size determined by
moments analysis to the hwhmpsf parameter value.
.le
.ls niterate = 3
The maximum number of centroiding iterations.
.le
.ls maxshift = 5.0
The maximum centroiding x and y shifts in pixels.
.le
.ls nxblock = INDEF, nyblock = INDEF
The working block size. If undefined nxblock and nyblock default to the number
of columns and rows in the input image respectively.
.le

DESCRIPTION

XFSHIFTS computes total offsets for the images in the input image list
\fIinlist\fR and writes the results in a form suitable for input to the
xnregistar task to \fIoutput\fR. If the \fIshifts\fR parameter is defined
the relative offsets for adjacent images are written to the file \fIshifts\fR.

XFSHIFTS requires the input image list to be ordered and also requires that
the relative offsets between adjacent images are approximately equal
to \fIxlag\fR and \fIylag\fR pixels.

XFSHIFTS computes the relative offsets between adjacent images by first
detecting objects in each input image using the STARFIND task,  and then
centroidiing the object lists in adjacent images and computing relative
shifts using the IMCENTROID task.

STARFIND searches the input images for local density maxima with half-widths at
half-maxima of ~ \fIhwhmpsf\fR and peak amplitudes greater than \fIthreshold\fR
counts above the local background, which are brighter than all surrounding
objects within a radius of \fIsepmin\fR * \fIhwhmpsf\fR pixels. Data within
\fIfradius\fR * \fIhwhmpsf\fR pixels of the detected density maximum and within
the good data range defined by the \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR parameters
are used to estimate the object position, shape, and size relative to the PSF.
Objects outside the shape and size limits specified by the \fIroundlo\fR,
\fIroundhi\fR, \fIsharplo\fR, and \fIsharphi\fR parameters are eliminated from
the final object list. By default STARFIND reads the entire input image into
memory. If the input images become too large or memory is limited the
\fInyblock\fR parameter can be set. For the sake of efficiency \fInxblock\fR
should be left set to INDEF so that XFSHIFTS always operates on an integral
number of image lines. More information on the STARFIND algorithms can be found
in the STARFIND task help page.

IMCENTROID computes accurate centers for all the detected objects in 
adjacent image pairs using a simple centroiding algorithm and a centering box
size of \fIcbox\fR. Objects that cannot be centered in \fIniterate\fR or
fewer iterations or whose x and y shifts deviate by more than \fImaxshift\fR
pixels from the expected shifts in both image are rejected. The remaining
objects are used to compute the relative offsets between adjacent images.
If adjacent frames contain no objects in common the relative offsets are set
to \fIxlag\fR and \fIylag\fR. Total offsets are computed by summing the
relative offsets.

EXAMPLES

1. Compute the total offsets for a series of 250 ONIS sky subtracted images
which are offset by approximately 50 pixels in x and 0.5 pixels in y. Output
both the total and relative offsets. Since the noise in the sky background
for these images is around 12 ADU use a detection threshold of 50 ADU.
