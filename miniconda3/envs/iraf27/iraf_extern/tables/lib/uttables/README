This directory contains the source for the Fortran-callable SDAS table I/O
routines.  All procedure names begin with "ut".  The next letter gives some
idea of the kind of object the procedure deals with (t - table in general,
r - row, c - column, p - parameter, h - header parameter).

The doc subdirectory contains further information in the following files:

UTTABLES.DOC	a description of each routine and a simple example program
CALLS.DOC	a list of routines and their calling sequences
USERPAR.DOC	characteristics of "header" parameters (i.e. user parameters)
UTPPTI.DOC	a note about using utppti
