     This note describes the use of utppti (or tbpset) to specify character-
istics of a table, such as whether it should be row-ordered or column-ordered.
The include file
        stsdas$lib/iraf77.inc

or the SPP header file
        <tbset.h>

give parameters and their numerical values for setting such characteristics.
For example, to specify that a table should be column-ordered you would call
utppti after calling uttinn:

        include 'stsdaslib:iraf77.inc'		! if stsdaslib is defined

        call uttinn (tblnam, tp, istat)                 ! initialize new table
        call utppti (tp, TBWTYP, TBTYPC, istat)         ! set column-ordered
C or    call utppti (tp, 5, 12, istat)                  ! (same as above)
        call utcdef (tp, ...                            ! define columns
        call uttcre (tp, istat)                         ! create the table

     The characteristics that may be set (for the moment) and their default
values are given below.  The first column is the integer parameter as defined
in the include file tbset.inc (in disk$sdas:[sdas.develop.sdasinc]), and the
second column gives its numerical value.  This is the value that should be
passed as the second argument to utppti.  The third argument is the value that
is to be set.  An (R) or (C) beginning the description means that the parameter
is relevant only for row-ordered or column-ordered tables respectively.
Any of these except table type (row- or column-ordered) may be set after
opening the table, but this will usually entail reorganizing the table, which
could take some time if the table is large.

parameter     value              description
---------     -----              -----------
TBRLEN          1       (R) Length of row (unit = size of real); this is com-
                        puted automatically as columns are defined, so the
                        default is the minimum length required for whatever
                        columns have been defined.
TBIRLN          2       (R) Increase row length by specified amount; the idea
                        is that you can define all the columns that you know
                        you will need, and then use this option to allocate
                        additional space if you expect to define other columns
                        later after opening the table.
TBALLR          3       (C) Number of rows to allocate; the default is 100 rows.
TBIALR          4       (C) Increase allocated number of rows by the specified
                        amount beyond the current number of allocated rows.
TBWTYP          5       Specify row-ordered (the default) or column-ordered;
                        the value that designates row-ordered is TBTYPR = 11,
                        while column-ordered is TBTYPC = 12.
TBMXPR          6       "Maximum" number of user parameters; the default is 5.
                        This does not set a firm upper limit to the number but
                        only specifies how much space to allocate.  If more
                        parameters are written to the table it will be reorgan-
                        ized to allow more space.
TBMXCL          7       "Maximum" number of columns; if not specified, the value
                        may be from zero to five more than the number of columns
                        that have already been defined, and there is no need to
                        specify this value if all columns are defined before
                        opening the table.  As with the maximum number of user
                        parameters, this is not a firm upper limit but only the
                        amount of space to be allocated for column descriptors.
