     This memo describes the characteristics of the I/O routines for user
parameters ("header" parameters) for tables.  Please note that these have
nothing to do with column descriptors or table info such as the number of
rows.

     Parameters are stored in a manner very similar to the FITS style:
a keyword (up to eight characters, case-insensitive) followed by a value.
Each parameter takes 80 bytes of storage in the table.  The data types
supported are text string, Boolean, integer, real, and double precision.
A parameter written as a text string may only be read as a text string,
but a parameter written as Boolean or numeric may be read as any data type
(true and false correspond to 1 and 0 respectively).  The data type of an
existing parameter can be changed simply by rewriting the parameter.
There are subroutines (uth... and tbh...) for getting or putting parameters
using keywords, and there is a tbhgnp routine (get Nth parameter) for getting
the keyword and value (as a text string) of a parameter by number.  If the
keyword is blank or is "COMMENT" or "HISTORY" then the put-text routine will
always add a new parameter rather than overwrite an existing one.  The
get-text routine, however, will always retrieve the first such parameter.
