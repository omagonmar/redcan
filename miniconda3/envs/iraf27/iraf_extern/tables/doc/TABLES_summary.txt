This release of TABLES incorporates relatively minor updates to
applications and libraries. The full details can be found in the
full release notes.

The Science Software Group is engaged in an effort to move to having
most of its software development done in Python. This release of
STSDAS/TABLES (v3.1) has tasks that require our command language
for IRAF called PyRAF (see pyraf.stsci.edu).

PyRAF 1.1 is being released at the same time as STSDAS/TABLES v3.1.
Only STSDAS has Python-based tasks in this release. No tasks in
TABLES are Python-based tasks, though this may not be true in
future releases.

Packages or tasks that have had minor enhancements or bug fixes include:


ttools..thedit

Changes to libraries:


gflib
tbtables

Parameter files that have changed (new parameters or new default values,
excluding parameters indicating version number changes):

fitsio/strfits.par           - 'oldirafname' default changed (to yes)
