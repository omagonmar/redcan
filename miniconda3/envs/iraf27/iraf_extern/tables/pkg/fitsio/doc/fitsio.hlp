NAME
fitsio -- Overview of the 'fitsio' package.
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The 'fitsio' package is a set of tasks that convert files to 
and from FITS format.

FITS CAPABILITIES IN STSDAS
The programs under 'fitsio',namely 'stwfits' and 'strfits',handle GEIS
files in a reasonable way while maintaining consistency with the FITS
standard.

The default group parameter block (GPB), which is located at the 
end of each group in the data file, contains values for the 
following keywords:

.nf
    DATAMIN    Minimum pixel value for group
    DATAMAX    Maximum pixel value for group
    CRPIXn     Pixel position for the 'n' axis
    CRVALn     Transformation value for the 'n' axis
               corresponding to the 'CRPIXn' pixel
    CDmn       Matrix describing scale and orientation 
               of the axis
.fi

These keywords names and the value they represent are described
in the GEIS header file which, for each 
parameter (i), contains the keywords 'PTYPEi', 'PDTYPEi', and 
'PSIZEi'.  'PTYPEi' is the parameter name, 'PDTYPEi' is its 
data type, and 'PSIZEi' is its size in bits.

'stwfits' lets you create one FITS file from a GEIS 
file, retaining the information in all the groups together 
with the group parameter block.  In 'stwfits' there is a 
parameter called 'gftoxdim' which, when set, converts the 
multigroup file to a FITS file  that has an extra dimension 
to account for the multiple groups and an appended table that 
contains the group parameter block.

It is also possible to produce a separate FITS file for every 
group in the multigroup GEIS source file.  There is then no 
appended table; instead, group information is contained in 
the FITS header.  If you want a separate FITS file for every 
group, then set the parameter 'gftoxdim = no'. (See examples.)

Going the opposite way, 'strfits' can be used to convert a 
FITS file to a multigroup GEIS file while retaining its group 
structure. Set the parameter xdimtogf to "yes" to recreate
the multigroup GEIS file.

If the 'xdimtogf' parameter is set to "no" then from a FITS file
that was created using the 'gftoxdim' flag to "yes",
you will get 3 files on disk. A 
single-group GEIS file with an extra dimension, the GEIS data file 
and a STSDAS table containing the GPB.

If you have a tape with one FITS file per group, you can reconstruct
the multigroup file using the GEIS header file with the GPB
description that you intend to include in your output GEIS file.  For
example, if the original FITS files were created from a mutigroup HRS
GEIS file, then you will probably want to have an HRS GEIS header file
handy, so that you can use it to pass GPB information to 'strfits',
this is done through the parameter 'template'.  If no header filename
is given to 'template', then a default GPB will be created for the
resulting GEIS file.

The template file is a 
GEIS header file containing the keywords 'PTYPEn', 'PDTYPEn', 
and 'PSIZEn' for each group parameter, plus the keywords 
'PCOUNT' and 'PSIZE'. The template is used by passing its file
name to the 'template' parameter.
Use a header file appropriate to your FITS
data, i.e., if the FITS files contain WF/PC data, use a WF/PC
header file.

A summary of options offered by 'stwfits' and 'strfits' 
follows.

'stwfits':

.nf
    - Can write multigroup images in stack mode.
    - Can write multigroup images as one FITS file 
      per group.
    - Can produce standard FITS tables from STSDAS
      tables, with 'XTENSION', 'TABLE' and 'BINTABLE'.
    - Can write FITS data in FITS IEEE standard.
    - Can write a FITS file from an ASCII file.

'strfits':

    - Can read all FITS files produced by 'stwfits'.
    - Can produced STSDAS images with a user-defined 
      group parameter block.
    - Can read FITS files with IUE data.

SCALING DATA

The original FITS standard calls for all floating and double data types
to be converted to 32-bit integer data. Scaling is done by 'stwfits'
by setting the parameter 'scale=yes', and is automatic when 
'autoscale=yes',
i.e., the values of 'bscale' and 'bzero' are determined by the program.
Hence, there is an associated loss of precision when trying to
recover the data from FITS files to disk images.
The new FITS standard now uses the IEEE FITS standard where single and
double precision data is stored in IEEE floating point format. No loss
of precision occurred when using this facility. Set the 'ieee' parameter
to 'yes' in the 'stwfits' task to write your data in this new standard.

WRITING MULTIGROUP IMAGES AS FITS FILES AND VICE VERSA

1) Use 'stwfits' with the 'gftoxdim' parameter set to "yes" 
and the output files directed to a remote Sun machine to create a 
FITS file with an extra dimension to account for a multigroup 
GEIS file with a table for the group parameter block 
information. Be sure to use the 'ieee' parameter to preserve 
the precision of floating point values. You can use a tape for
output; the procedure is the same.

For example, use the following command to tranfer all files 
with extension '.c1h'.

.nf
  fi> stwfits *.c1h  sol!/sol/u1/user/root gftoxdim=yes ieee+
.fi


If you want to recreate the original multigroup
file, you can perform the operation in one step with the following
command:
.nf

  fi> strfits root*  iraf_file=groot  xdimtogf+ old+ 

.fi

2) Use 'strfits' to read the files and create a GEIS file 
with an extra dimension and a table. If scaling was performed 
in the FITS file then set the appropriate parameter to create 
the GEIS file with a data type other than the FITS file 
default.

For example:
.nf

  fi> set imtype=hhh
  fi> strfits root*  iraf_file=groot  old+  xdimtogf-

.fi
Notice than you want to set 'imtype=hhh' (for GEIS files)        
and have the original name on the output files.

With the command above you will end up with 3 files: the header, 
the data, and the table containing the group parameter block. The 
resulting GEIS file name will have a suffix '_cvt' appended to the
root name letting you know the image have an extra dimension and
that a table filename has been created with the same root name,
with group parameter block information.

3) Use 'strfits' to read 4 FITS files from tape and create 
one GEIS image with 4 groups. Assume the FITS files contain
WF/PC data. Use a template file with a GEIS WF/PC header file,
e.g., 'twfpc.hhh'.

.nf

  fi> strfits mta 1-4  newpfc.hhh[1/4]  template='twfpc.hhh' xdimtogf-

.fi
You need to tell 'strfits' that the resulting GEIS file will
have 4 groups and that you are starting with group 1. The 'xdimtogf'
is set to "no" since you don't have a FITS file with an extra dimension.
