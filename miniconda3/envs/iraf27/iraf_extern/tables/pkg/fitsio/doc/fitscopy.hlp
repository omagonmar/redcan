NAME
fitscopy -- Copy FITS files from disk or tape to a tape.
.ih
USAGE
fitscopy  infiles  outfiles  file_list  newtape
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task will transfer FITS files from disk to tape with
optional blocking, tape to disk, or tape to tape with optional
blocking. To transfer FITS files from disk to disk, use
the 'copy' command.
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls infiles [file name template]
Source file(s) to be transferred. 

This can be a single
disk filename or the name of a tape drive (e.g., "mta"). It can also be a
list of files, e.g., 'file1.fit', 'myfile*.fit', or '@filelist'.
.le
.ls outfile [file name template]
Destination for output files. 

This can be a single
disk filename or the name of a tape drive (e.g., "mta"). It can also be a
list of files, e.g., 'file1.fit', 'file2.fit', or '@filelist'.
If a file name is passed to this
parameter, files will be written to disk.  If more than one file is to be
written to disk, the file number will be appended to the root of 
the filename specification plus an extension if one was given.
Files can be  written to magnetic tape by using a tape drive
specification rather than a file name.  The tape drive specification
takes the form "mt*" where "mt" indicates a tape device, "*"
represents one or more characters.
The 'newtape' parameter can be set to "yes" and tape output  will be
written at the beginning of the tape.
If 'newtape' is not set to "yes",
then the output will be appended to the tape after the last file.
To use the tape you need to allocate it with the 'allocate' command,
for example, "allocate mta".
.le
.ls file_list [string]
The files to be read from a tape. This string can consist of
any sequence of file numbers separated by at least one comma
or dash. A comma separates individual file numbers, whereas a
dash specifies  a range of files.  For example the string
"1,2,3-5,8-6" will convert tape files 1 through 8.
.le
.ls (newtape) [boolean]
Is the tape blank? 
 
Setting 'newtape=yes' will cause files to be written at the beginning of the
tape.
.le
.ls (blocking_factor = 1) [integer]
The tape blocking factor for FITS files.  

2,880-byte records are normally assumed.  If the blocking factor is
greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, then 2,880-byte records
will be written to a single tape record. The FITS standard specifies
that 'blocking_factor' must be less than or equal to 10.
.le
.ls offset = 0 [integer]
Number from which to start counting when generating the number that is
appended to the file name specified by 'outfiles' to create the output
file name.  For example if 'file_list = "1-3"', 'outfiles = "out"' and
'offset = 100', the the three files 'out101', 'out102', 'out103' would
be produced rather than 'out001', 'out002' and 'out003'.
.le
.ls verbose = yes [boolean]
Print messages to the screen as files are copied?

EXAMPLES
1. Transfer all the files that match 'foo' with extension '.fit'
   to the beginning of the tape 'mta'. Use blocking factor 10.

.nf
  fi> fitscopy  foo*.fit  mta  newtape=yes  blocking=10
.fi

2. Copy the first 3 files  from tape 'mte' to the working directory
   with filename root 'myfile' and extension 'fit'. This will create
   files 'myfiles001.fit', 'myfile002.fit' and 'myfile003.fit'.

.nf
 fi> fitscopy  mta  myfile.fit 1-3
.fi

.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
Transfer to and from Exabyte tapes are considerably slow.
