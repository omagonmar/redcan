NAME
gftoxdim -- Convert a multigroup GEIS file to a single group GEIS 
file.
.ih
USAGE
gftoxdim input output
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A multigroup GEIS file does not use IRAF's image I/O capabilities as
efficiently as does a single image file.  Converting a multigroup
GEIS file to a single group file allows the entire 
multigroup file to be treated as one image. The 'gftoxdim' task 
converts a multigroup GEIS file to a single group GEIS file that 
contains only the data portion of the group, and not the
group parameter block (GPB).  The GPB will go in an STSDAS table 
with one column for each group parameter and a row for each group.

The header file created by 'gftoxdim' will inherit the group 
parameter
names and values of the last group.  It will also have keywords
appended to it that describe the table with its extra dimension.
If there was only one group in the GEIS file, there will be no extra
dimension, but the table will still be created with only one row.

PARAMETERS
.ls input [file name template]
The input file specification can be a template for a group of
files, e.g., 'z00*.*h', or a list of files, separated by commas.
.le
.ls output [file name template]
Output file specification. This is a single file specification,
or a directory

specified, the number of output files must match the number of input
files.
