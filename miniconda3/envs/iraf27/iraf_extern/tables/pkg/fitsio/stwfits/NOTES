stwfits version 0.1  11-May-1995.

The following problems have been resolved from the March 10, 1995 version.

fits_cards.x/chgfmt()
	If the column datatype is negative, then it indicates the number
	of characters of storage for that characters type column. The
	previous version was taken the display format rather that the
	column datatype. Solved by taking the abs(datatype) as the width
	of the newly created column.

stwfits.par
	Add Version parameter to keep track of revisions.

t_wfits.x
	Update 'version' string to '11-May-1995'.

tab_wheader.x 
	Add ORIGIN keyword to the dummy header when creating a FITS
	file out of an STSDAS table. This keyword contain the site and
	date of the FITSIO version.
